# 03 Prepare : Reading & Quiz

##### Due Monday before class

It should take two hours to complete the reading and an hour to complete the reading quiz.

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 3\. Processes

Processes are a fundamental unit of execution on operating-systems. Pay particular attention on the components of a process (call stack, heap, etc.) and how processes create other processes.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
