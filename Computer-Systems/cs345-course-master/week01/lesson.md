# 01 Prepare : Introduction to CS345

The first week of CS345 is an introduction to the course and operating systems.  You will also be writing c++ programs on the Linux system and submitting your projects the same method as when you took CS124, CS165 and CS235.

> **Reading** is key to doing well in this course.  You will be required to read parts of the textbook each week.

### Syllabus

Please carefully read the syllabus so you will know how to best allocate your time and focus your efforts.  The Syllabus is found in Canvas.

## Reading

Each week you are expected to read the required sections in the textbook before Wednesday's class time. A reading quiz is also due before Monday's class time.

There will be two components to the reading this week: the course materials and the textbook. The course materials include the syllabus and the course I-Learn site. The textbook component of the reading includes chapter 1 and parts of Chapter 12.


### Chapter 1 - Introduction

In many ways, this chapter is a brief summary of everything we will be learning about for the remainder of the semester. Just about everything here will be discussed in more detail later in the semester. That being said, this chapter is among the most important. It shows how all the pieces fit together into a single cohesive whole. As we go into more detail later, it will be easy to lose sight of the interactions between the parts. It is therefore a good idea to focus on these interactions as you read Chapter 1.

### Chapter 12 - I/O Systems : Section 12.1 and 12.2

The remainder of the reading will go into perhaps too much detail on how the operating-system interacts with the hardware of the computer. We will not go into too much detail here; **please just skim this section**.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
