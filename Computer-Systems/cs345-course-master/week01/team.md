# 01 Teach : Analogy of an Operating System

##### Please work together in groups of 2 or 3

Our team activity this week is to come up with an analogy explaining what an operating-system does. Your group will share their analogy in class.

## Analogy

The Lord taught His disciples and others using parables. Perhaps this was done because the principles being taught were abstract and difficult to understand. By relating Gospel principles to farming, traveling, and working, these principles became more approachable. Analogies have the same teaching power as parables. They benefit the learner by providing a bridge between familiar concepts and new ones. It turns out that they can benefit the teacher in the same way.

The process of making analogies to capture abstract or complex concepts helps us to better understand the concepts themselves. It forces us to ask questions and explore the bounds of our understanding as we strive to verify and elaborate on our analogies.

### Overview of Operating-Systems

Please create an analogy to describe the major parts and functions of an operating-system. This analogy must be a real-world thing, not another computer program (like a hospital as opposed to a video game). Your analogy must contain the following components:

1.  **Purpose**: Relate the purpose of an operating-system to the purpose of the real-world thing you are relating it to.
2.  **Components**: An operating-system is meant to control or police several components. These include the CPU, hard disk, I/O devices, and main memory. Each of these components must be in your analogy.
3.  **Processors**: An operating-system can work with single-processor, multi-processor, and clustered systems. All of these must be covered in your analogy.
4.  **Environments**: Some operating-systems are optimized for traditional computing, some for mobile computing, some for client-server systems, and some for real-time scenarios. Please make sure to include each in your analogy.

### Sharing your Analogy

Your teams analogy will be shared in class so you can get feedback from your fellow students.

## Example

The following is an example of a "good" analogy. It is meant to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. In other words, please do not use it as a template for your analogy.

Subject: **Hospital**

Just as a hospital is a organization designed to serve many patients, an operating-system is a software system designed to serve many program. The hospital is an intermediary between the care-givers and the patients so the highest quality care can be offered with the least amount of overhead. In much the same way, the operating-system is an intermediary between the hardware of the computing system and the programs that run on the hardware.

Every hospital consists of one or more doctor who performs the care that the patient needs. Often the doctor needs to store or access records pertaining to the patient's health. The doctor frequently sends data out of the hospital on behalf of the patient, such as prescription orders, notifications to other care-givers, or to insurance companies. Similarly, the doctor may need to accept input from external sources. These may include drugs or other medical supplies, information pertaining to the patient's health, advice or instructions from other caregivers, or funds. Finally, as the doctor works, he or she may need to take short-term notes pertaining to the immediate status of the patient's care or the procedure currently being performed. These actions relate to the CPU (the doctor performing the work on the patient), the hard disk (medical, financial, or other types of records), the I/O devices (data sent out of the hospital as well as input from external sources), and main memory (short-term notes generated and used in the process of giving care to the patient).

Some hospitals operate with a single doctor, such as a military field hospital. This works much like a single-processor system. Some hospitals have many doctors working at the same time, whether they be working on the same patient or distributing their talents across many patients. This works much like a multi-processor system. Finally, some hospitals have an agreement with neighboring hospitals. This allows them to offload patients when there is a rush or to share expensive resources. This works much like a clustered system.

The traditional hospital has many doctors and is designed to serve many patients at the same time. This functions much like the traditional computing model. Some hospitals are optimized to give quick aid using the minimal amount of resources. Mobile computing works much like this. Other hospitals are designed to provide help to remote patients who are not physically present but need periodic medical advice such as Web-MD. This works much like a client-server system. Finally, some hospitals are designed to handle emergencies where waiting for help is not an option, such as an emergency room. This is much like how a real-time system works.

* **CPU** == doctor
* **Hard disk** == patient records
* **I/O** == prescriptions out and medical supplies in
* **Main Memory** == short-term notes
* **Single-processor** == single doctor office
* **Multi-processor** == many doctors in a single hospital
* **Cluster** == many hospitals working together
* **Traditional Computing** == typical city hospital
* **Mobile Computing** == event aid station
* **Client-Server** == Web-MD
* **Real-time System** == emergency room

## Team Activity Quiz

Don't forget to complete the weekly team activity quiz that is due each Thursday evening at midnight.  The quiz can be found in Canvas.  There is no method of submitting a late quiz.  I would suggest you create a weekly reminder on your computer or cell phone.

# Extra (If you need more to do)

Write a c program that prompts the user for two file names (source and destination) where it copies the contents of the source file to the destination file. **Please don't just search for this code on the Internet!**. Note: This is to be a c program not **C++**.  Your source file should have the extension of ".c". (ie., the statement 'cout' should NOT work in your code.)

Sample Output

```as
Enter source file: source.txt
Enter destination file: dest.txt
5465 bytes where copied.
```
