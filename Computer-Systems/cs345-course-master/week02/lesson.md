# 02 Prepare : Operating-System Structures

##### Due Monday before class

It should take two hours to complete the reading and an hour to complete the reading quiz.

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook. Before reading this chapter, you might want to go through the reading quiz so you know what to look for.

### Chapter 2\. Operating-System Structures

The purpose of this chapter is to understand why operating-systems are organized the way they are. While you will probably never write your own operating-system, a good working knowledge of how they are built helps us better utilize the services they provide.

Pay particular attention to Section 2.3 System Calls. Most of the libraries we call from our high-level programming languages (such as the C++ Standard Library, the Java Class Library, or the .NET Framework) translate into system calls. By understanding what these system calls look like and how they are organized, we can write more efficient and powerful code.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
