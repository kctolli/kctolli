# Prepare 04 : Reading & Quiz

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 6\. CPU Scheduling

This chapter describes how the operating-system divides CPU cycles in such a way that all the processes get the processing power the need. Please pay particular attention to the various scheduling algorithms as they will be relevant for the coding exercise and the problem set this week.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
