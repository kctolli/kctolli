# Prepare 10 : Virtual Memory

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 8\. Virtual Memory

This is a continuation of last week's topic. The most important things to glean from this chapter are:

*   It is very expensive when a page fault occurs. The operating-system and the programmer need to work together to minimize the chance a fault occurs.
*   In a multi-process environment, one should strive to not modify a page unless it is unavoidable.
*   The choice of page replacement algorithm can have a big influence on the number of page faults.
*   Thrashing is bad. It is very bad!

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
