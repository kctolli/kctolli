# Ponder 13 : White Paper Completion

##### Due Monday night at Midnight MST

This is a completion of our White Paper assignment. As you may recall, there are six steps in this process: 
1) Perform Research
2) Gather Data
3) Analyze
4) Report
5) Review
6) Publish. 

Your completed White Paper should be accurate, professional, and informative. In short, it should be ready for publication. 


Produce a white paper providing guidance to software developers on the number of threads that a program should use based on data you have collected yourself. The white paper should include the following factors:

*   The number of processors a system has
*   The type of processing done by the program (CPU bound vs. IO bound)
*   Any other variable/factor that you manipulated during your test

The objective of the white paper is to provide software developers with some basic guidelines about how many threads to use in multithreaded programs. Assume an audience of junior level CS majors. Don’t assume that the CS majors are only from BYU-Idaho. Look at the references you found for some guidelines as to how the paper is to be formatted and what tone to use with your language.

Some general guidelines:

1.  The paper should be 2-5 pages in length.
2.  White papers come in various forms but generally have an introduction/executive summary, body and a summary/conclusions.
3.  Your white paper should have a cover page that includes a title, your name, course name, and date.
4.  Put graphs in-line with the text; not collected at the end of the paper.
5.  Tables, graphs and figures should be large enough to be readable.
6.  Avoid the use of terms such as “a lot,” “substantial,” “many,” and so forth. In some cases a difference of 1% is “a lot.” In other cases “a lot” might mean a difference of 25%, 80%, 300% or more.
7.  Cite everything used from an external source. You can use whatever citation method you like for this.


### Final Read

Believe it or not, the best way to tell if your writing makes sense is to read it. I mean read it aloud to an empty room. This might sound crazy but it actually works.

Read every word of your paper out loud. If a sentence is awkward or if a word does not quite seem right, take a few minutes to work on it. Then, begin again from the start of the paragraph and see if it flows better. Continue with this process until you are sure the paper flows smoothly.
