# Prepare 13 : Protection and Security

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter plus one extra section from the textbook

### Chapter 13 - Protection

This chapter will elaborate on some things we touched on briefly last week. As you read this chapter, pay special attention the various ways that an operating-system can provide protection assurances to the user.

### Section 14.1 - The Security Problem

This section will provide a brief overview of things we will learn about in CS 470 Security. It is included in this week's reading to give you an idea as to why operating-system protection is an important service.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
