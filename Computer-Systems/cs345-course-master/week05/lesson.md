# Prepare 05 : Reading & Quiz

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook and one section.

### Chapter 4\. Threads

Two weeks ago, we discussed the necessity of an operating-system to run more than one program concurrently. This week, we will discuss how one program can run more than one task concurrently. We will first learn why this is important, then we will learn how to accomplish this in the code.

### Section 6.4 Thread Scheduling

Please also re-read a section from last week. This section made several references to threads (as is obvious from the chapter) that might make more sense now that we have a better understanding of how threads differ from processes.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
