# Team Activity 05 : Threads to Calculate PI

##### Please work together in groups of 2 or 3


## Instructions

- Copy the file /home/cs345/teamActivities/team05.c to your personal account on the Linux account.
- Add code to this code file to calculate PI using the Monte Carlo Method with multiple threads.

## Suggestions / Notes

- Step 1: Add code in main() to calculate PI.
- Step 2: copy the code in step 1 into one thread.  Test to make sure that you get the same results.
- Step 3: modify the program to use multiple threads to calculate PI.
