# Ponder 12 : White Paper assignment

##### Due Monday night at Midnight MST

There are six steps in the white paper process: 
1) Perform Research
2) Gather Data
3) Analyze
4) Report
5) Review
6) Publish. 

The perform research component of the paper are described in [Prepare Research](research.md).

The gather data component of the paper are described in [Experiment](experiment.md).

The focus of this submission will be your data analysis. That being said, please submit what you have accomplished so far in a single document. This document should include: a) all of your sources, b) your data, c) your analysis of your data, and d) a rough outline of the final paper.

### a. Sources

Please include all of your sources (it may be only two) and a brief summary of what you got from them. This includes any statistics you will quote, any points you will use in your paper, and any direct quotes. This summary does not have to be longer than a couple sentences.

### b. Data

Please include the data you plan on using in your paper. This should not be "raw data" but rather data presented in an easy-to-understand format. You will need to put some thought into what this means.

### c. Analysis

The value of a white paper often comes from how the findings are understood. In other words, how can you reduce mounds of data into something that can be explained? There is not only one way to do this of course...

One method is to dump the data into a spreadsheet such as Excel and graph it. While looking at the data in a picture format, it is often easier to see trends. This requires, of course, that the data is in a format that Excel understands. In other words, you may need to modify the code to make it easier for Excel to parse or you may need to use some scripting to manipulate the data.

Another method is to collect data in such a way that it can be easily analyzed. For example, running the program several times with a systematic selection of thread count (1, then 2, then 4, then 8, then ... , then 256, etc.) makes it easier to spot trends rather than just picking one or two random numbers.

Whatever method you use, in the end you should have hard data supporting any conclusion or recommendation you make in your write-up.

Considering the following questions may help with this assignment:

*   How does the real time (elapsed or wall-clock time) vary when using different numbers of threads?
*   How do the user and system times vary when using different numbers of threads? What insights are gained from seeing how they change?

### d. Rough Outline

White papers come in various forms but generally have an introduction or executive summary, body and a summary/conclusions. This submission should have all those components even though much of it will be placeholders.

#### To turn this in:

Upload your Word or PDF document to Canvas.

### Assessment

Your grade for this activity will be according to the following rubric:
