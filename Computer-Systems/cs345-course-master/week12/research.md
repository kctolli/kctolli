# Prepare 12 : Research for White Paper

##### Due Tuesday night at Midnight MST

A white paper is an authoritative report on an issue for the purpose of giving information, making a recommendation, or making a proposal. A white paper needs to be grounded in research and data, there is no room for unsubstantiated opinions. Our purpose here is to write a white paper to address the following question:

> How many threads should be used for a given program?


## Perform Research

Before we begin collecting data for our paper, we need to learn what others have discovered. This requires performing some research. In other words, very little relevant data will be found in the provided course content.

Start by performing some preliminary research. This can be as simple as Googleâ„¢ searches or finding relevant articles in Wikipedia. It is OK to start with un-trustworthy sources like this; it is not OK to end there. In other words, after you have discovered the important keywords and jargon, you need to proceed to more trustworthy sources. As a general rule, a source is trustworthy if:

*   The author is a recognized expert in the field. You can tell if this is the case if there is some biography information at the end of the article. Read this biography and see if they author is qualified to speak on the subject on hand.
*   The source is a published textbook or technical manual. Publishers usually have editors verify that the printed content is accurate.
*   The source is published in a peer-reviewed journal such as IEEE and ACM. Here the contents of the articles are verified by qualified reviewers and thus are trustworthy.

Once you know exactly what to search for, you can go to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or the [David O. McKay Library](http://library.byui.edu/) to find high-quality sources. If you are on campus, then the links from Google Scholar will take you directly to these sources. Otherwise, you will need to copy the author and article title from Google Scholar and paste it into the library search field. This may take a bit of practice to get it right.

Your goal here is not to have an exhaustive literature review of thread performance, but rather to find a couple articles that are relevant to this white paper.

Considering the following questions may help with this assignment:

*   How does the real time (elapsed or wall-clock time) vary when using different numbers of threads?
*   How do the user and system times vary when using different numbers of threads? What insights are gained from seeing how they change?
