# Prepare 06 : Reading & Quiz

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of a half chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 5\. Process Synchronization

These next two weeks, we will learn how to keep processes from interfering with each other. While the title is "Process Synchronization," it would perhaps be better titled as "Thread Synchronization" because most of these issues occur when multiple threads of the same process work on the same data item. In other words, since threads tend to share data whereas processes tend not to, most of our discussion will center on synchronizing threads.

There are 11 sections in this chapter (aside from the summary at the end). We will read the first 6 this week and the final 5 next week.

#### Section 5.1 Background

This section will show what kinds of problems may be encountered if not properly handled.

#### Section 5.2 The Critical-Section Problem

Here we will learn the characteristics of process synchronization solutions.

#### Section 5.3 Peterson's Solution

This section presents a simplistic solution with the associated shortcomings.

#### Section 5.4 Synchronization Hardware

A first full solution of the synchronization problem is presented.

#### Section 5.5 Mutex Locks

Mutexs are powerful to handle most issues and are easy to understand.

#### Section 5.6 Semaphores

Pay attention to both flavors: binary and counting. Our lab this week and next will require both flavors of semaphores.

#### Section 5.7 - Section 5.11

You might want to read ahead for next week.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
