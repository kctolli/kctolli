# 06 Teach : Analogy

##### Due Friday night at Midnight MST

The first Teach One Another activity this week will be to create an analogy to describe process synchronization problems and solutions. This will work exactly the same as last week: you will create an analogy with one or two classmates and submit it as a finished product.

## Analogy

Create an analogy to describe the process synchronization. Your analogy must cover the following topics:

1.  The situations when synchronization issues may arise
2.  The essential characteristics of synchronization solutions (See 5.2 in the textbook)
3.  The mutex and binary semaphore solution (See 5.5 and 5.6 in the textbook)
4.  The counting semaphore solution (see 5.6 in the textbook)

As with the previous analogy, 20% extra credit if you can use one canalogy to cover all the bases.

### 1\. When Synchronization Issues Occur

Your analogy must clearly describe real-world problems that occur when synchronization issues arise. Explain what characterizes these situations. Finally, describe the fallout of not handling these issues correctly.

### 2\. Characteristics of Solutions

The textbook list three requirements of synchronization solutions. Each of these must be clearly explained in your analogy.

### 3\. Mutex and Binary Semaphores

Explain mutex and binary semaphore solutions so the everyday person can understand them. These must be explained in the context of your analogy of course. In other words, how would one implement a mutex or binary semaphore to solve the problem described in the analogy in such a way that the three characteristics are met?

### 4\. Counting Semaphores

As with the mutex and binary semaphore item above, do the same with counting semaphores. Finding a real-world analogy to describe the counting semaphore might be the biggest challenge of this assignment.

## Submission

As with last week, this assignment is to be completed in small groups as assigned by the instructor. You are to work with the members of your group on a single document. There will be a single submission point for this assignment.

### Citations

You need to make frequent references to the textbook or other resources in your analogy.

### Working together

Did your approach from last week work or will it need to be adjusted this week? In other words, change something if it did not work the first time. We will be doing plenty more analogies this semester. It is worth your while to experiment until you find a system that works. As a reminder, a few ways you can organize yourself are:

*   Divide and conquer
*   Roles
*   Stage-wise

### Grading

Recall that, by default, everyone in your group will get the same grade on the document. If you would like for me to adopt a different point-distribution process, please describe it in your submission.

### Submission

The final draft of the analogy is to be posted to the discussion board. As a reminder, you are to paste the text into the discussion board. In other words, **do not attach a document or provide a link**.

The subject of the post must be the names of the team members.

You will have only one chance to submit this document. After submission, do not modify your post or make corrections.

## Assessment

As with last week, your submission should be about two printed pages, give or take. The grading for this assignment is:

An extra 20% if one analogy can cover all the bases. Otherwise, use more than one analogy.
