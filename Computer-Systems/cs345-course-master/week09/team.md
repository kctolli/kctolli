# Teach 09 : Main Memory Analogy

##### Please work together in groups of 2 or 3

This week, we will create an analogy to describe main memory.

## Analogy

Create an analogy to describe the process synchronization. Your analogy must cover the following topics:

1.  Address Binding
2.  Paging
3.  Fragmentation

### 1\. Address Binding

Your analogy needs to cover the notion of main memory: a very large set of slots that hold "things," each of which can be accessed in any order.

It must differentiate logical addresses from physical addresses. In other words, there needs to be an abstraction enabling easier or more versatile access to the "things." The logical address description must explain this abstraction, but how it works and the utility of it.

Finally, there must be a description of address binding. This enables one to move between the logical address space and the physical space.

### 2\. Paging

Your analogy needs to cover the notion of paging, including the paging mechanism that converts logical addresses to physical addresses. Specifically, you need to cover the page table and the TLB.

### 3\. Fragmentation

Can you explain fragmentation to your mother? This includes both internal and external fragmentation. Explain why fragmentation is bad and a few strategies to minimize it.
