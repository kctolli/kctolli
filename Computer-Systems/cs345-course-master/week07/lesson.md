# Prepare 07 : Reading & Quiz

##### Due Monday before class time

The reading this week will consist of a half chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 5\. Process Synchronization

We will finish Chapter 5 this week. If you did not understand any part of the first 7 sections from last week, you might want to re-read it now.

#### Section 5.7 Classic Problems of Synchronization

This section will present three classic synchronization problems. It would be worthwhile to study them because they can crop up in everyday programming tasks. Recognizing one of these problems is the first step to solving the problem.

#### Section 5.8 Monitors

A monitor is a powerful tool enabling us to more easily deal with common synchronization problems.

#### Section 5.9 Synchronization Examples

Less abstract than the previous sections, here specific implementations are presented on common operating-systems.

#### Section 5.10 Alternative Approaches

Perhaps semaphores will not be the tool of choice in the future. This section explores a few alternative designs.

#### Section 5.11 Deadlock

Deadlocks represent many worst-case situations for synchronization issues. Recognizing these situations is the first step in fixing them.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
