# Prepare 11 : Mass Storage

##### Due Monday before class time

## Reading

The reading this week will consist of one chapter from the textbook.

### Chapter 9\. Mass-Storage Structure

Some may argue that the relevance of this chapter has faded somewhat in recent years. While this chapter devotes a great deal of attention to hard disks, flash memory is clearly the wave of the future; most new laptops come with solid-state drives today. That being said, hard disks are now and will be for the foreseeable future, the most economical way to purchase large amounts of mass-storage that our current digital lifestyle demands.

As you read this chapter, pay special attention to the following:

*   The performance characteristics of the various mass-storage systems.
*   Disk scheduling algorithms, not only important for hard disks but for many other applications as well. We will be implementing these for our lab this week.
*   RAID configurations.

## Quiz

##### Due Wednesday before class time

Quizzes are found in Canvas for the course. You may take the quiz as many times as you like. Only your highest grade on the quiz will be recorded.  Each week the quiz will close before Monday's class time.

Here is my suggested way to do this:

1.  Take the quiz before doing the reading.
2.  Next, read the chapter all the way through, looking for the items mentioned in the quiz.
3.  Finally take the quiz a second time, looking up the items that are specifically mentioned in the quiz.

Hint: write down your answers before submitting! If you do not get a 100% on this second attempt, you will need to re-take the quiz. If you write down your answers, then you will have to do less work on the re-take.
