## Channels

Communication is divided into channels. Most of our class-wide communication will happen in the **#general** channel.

In addition, you can send direct messages (ie., chats) to your instructor (or to other students). In fact, if you have a pressing question about something, you can often get a response faster by sending a direct message to the instructor than by emailing.


## Etiquette

It's important to be professional in your online communications. Aside from the standard guidelines of not using ALL-CAPS TO COMMUNICATE and speaking respectfully.  Please do no post assignment code on the course group.
