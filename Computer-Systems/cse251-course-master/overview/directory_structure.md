# Directory Structure used in the Course


This is the suggested directory structure for the course.  The example below has `cse251` as the main folder for the course.  The reason for this structure is to ensure that the cse251 library, `cse251.py`, can be found by your code (and when your assignments are being graded).

```text
cse251 (or what ever you want)
  - code
    - cse251.py

    - assignment
