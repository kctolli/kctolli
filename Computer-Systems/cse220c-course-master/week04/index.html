	<h1>Beyond Arrays</h1>
	<p>Up to this point, the only type of container you've seen is a C-type array being used in C++. While these arrays are interesting, they lead to so many common coding crashes and security defects that the C++ documentation says that <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/containers#arrays-are-evil">they are evil</a> and should be avoided in almost every situation. This is why C++ has a set of standard containers. These include, but are not limited to, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45723819/what-is-a-span-and-when-should-i-use-one">spans</a>, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pair-in-cpp-stl/">pairs</a>, <a href="https://thispointer.com/c11-stdtuple-tutorial-examples/">tuples</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/c-standard-template-library-stl-vector-a-pretty-simple-guide-d2b64184d50b">vectors</a>, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/">lists</a>, <a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-the-cpp-stl-map">maps</a>, and <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/6-15-an-introduction-to-stdarray/">non-C arrays</a>. The code for these containers is highly optimized. Rarely is anyone able to write <a href="https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/containers#slow-containers">more efficient code</a> to store multiple instances of classes compared to these standard containers. To help you begin your journey into the library of containers and thinking that way instead of in C-type arrays, this class focuses on lists and maps. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider the <span class="file_name">PharmaceuticalStockModel</span> class you saw last week. It Has_A unique pointer to a C type array of <span class="file_name">Medications</span>. 
	</p>
		<p>
	<pre><code>class PharmaceuticalStockModel{
    private:
        unique_ptr&lt;Medication[]&gt; in_stock_medications;
        long medicationCount;
        long medicationCapacity;
    public:
    /*
     * constructor and class function declarations here
     */
 }
</code>
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		While this works, it uses that evil C-type array. It can definitely be improved upon for flexibility, usability, and security.
	</p>
	<p>
		Consider this small part of the application's <a href="https://uxplanet.org/aligning-design-to-user-stories-614b4845fc8d">user story</a>. Using your application's User Interface (UI), your customer wants to select the name of a medication and see a list of all the bottles of that medication, when they were recieved, when they expire, and how many pills, or if liquid how much liquid, remains in each bottle. This can be done using C-type arrays, but the code will be slow since you will have to do a lot of searching...comparing the name of each medication in the array with the selected name and building a temporary C-type array to hold pointers or references to, heaven forbid copies of, each of the matching medications. Wow! Slow, error prone, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-robust-code-and-brittle-code">brittle</a>, insecure code. &#128561; 
	</p>
	<h1>Maps</h1>
	<p>
		All maps, a container type not the map functionality, including the map class in the standard library of C++, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/map/"><span class="file_name">std::map</span></a>, are very good at looking stuff up. Each map is a group of keys and values in pairs. These key-value pairs are so common in programming and applications that you've been using them for a long time without knowing it. Think about your music player on your phone. It has lists of the songs, artists, and music genre on your phone. When you select a song to play, what is actually happening? After all, the display doesn't contain the actual song file. Instead it's the name of the song, musician, or genre. Let's say you select a song name. That name is a key that is used to look up the song file to play. The song file is the value. Key - song name: Value - song file.
	</p>
	<p>
		'Wait a minute', you say. Doesn't the map just have an array inside? Isn't it going to look through that array just like I could? The answer to both of these questions is no. It is <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/red-black-tree-set-1-introduction-2/">much more sophisticated than that</a> and you'll learn more about this when you take the <span class="file_name">CSE212 Programming with Data Structures</span> and <span class="file_name">CSE232 Designing Data Structures</span> classes. For now, just believe there are computer scientists who have more knowledge than you do right now and map is designed by them to be significantly better than using a hidden array.
	</p>
	<p>
		Maps are good at looking things up. Looking up things in C++'s <span class="file_name">std::map</span> is O(log n) so let's modify the <span class="file_name">PharmaceuticalStockModel</span> class to have a map of medications instead of a unique_ptr to an array of medications. When this is done, what before was
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="C++">class PharmaceuticalStockModel{
    private:
        unique_ptr&lt;Medication[]&gt; in_stock_medications;
        long medication_count;
        long medication_capacity;
    public:
    /*
     * constructor and class function declarations here
     */
 }
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		becomes
	</p>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">class PharmaceuticalStockModel{
    using std::string;
    using std::map;
    private:
        map&lt;string,Medication&gt; in_stock_medications;
    public:
    /*
     * constructor and class function declarations here
     */
 }
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		Less code is good code! &#129299;</p>
	<p>
		Let's take a look at the lines that changed starting with the declaration of the <span class="file_name">in_stock_medications</span> instance variable. The changed line states that there is a instance variable named <span class="file_name">in_stock_medications</span> of type map where the key is a <span class="file_name">std::string</span> and the value is a list of <span class="file_name">Medications</span>. This is Sooo much simpler! Gone is the unique pointer. Gone is the C-type array. and gone are the <span class="file_name">medication_count</span> and <span class="file_name">medication_capacity</span> instance variables. Those last two were only there because a C-type array was used. They aren't needed anymore. Maps have infinite capacity and keep track of how many things are stored in them themselves. We don't have to do this separately like we had to when a C-type array was being used. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice in the declaration of the map, that there is some code that looks strange. &lt;string,Medication&gt. This is where you declare the types for the keys and values. The C++ standard map stores the keys and values in a <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/pair/pair/">std::pair instance</a>. The key is the first element of the pair and the value is the second element of the pair. The map declaration line in the previous code snippet tells the compiler that the map should hold pairs of type <span class="file_name">std::pair&lt;string,Medication&gt;</span>. This means that <span class="file_name">std::map</span> is something called a class <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/template">template</a>. 
	</p>
	<a name="template_description"><h2>Templates</h2>
	<p>
		If you had a template for a pair of pants, known as a pattern, you could use that template to make pants from denim, cotton, or even silk if you wanted to. They would all be pants. The template ensures that, regardless of the material used, the pants would all be the same size, be put on the same way, and have the same number and shape of pockets. This is what templates do; maintain commonality. C++'s <span class="file_name">std::map</span> is a template. It maintains commonality, but doesn't care what is stored in it as long as there is one key for one value. You can choose anything you want for a key and anything you want for a value. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As you know, a template (pattern) for a pair of pants isn't the same thing as having a pair of pants. Someone has to apply the pants template to cloth to create a pair of pants. This template to reality relationship is also true for <span class="file_name">std::map</span>. When the compiler reads code like <span class="file_name">map&lt;string,Medication&gt; in_stock_medications;</span> it 'says', "Oh...you have a template here for a map that uses a string for a key and a Medication for a value. I'll make a map for you that will do that. You're welcome." See? Your code informs the compiler what the template is for the container you want and it creates the code that is that container for you. Sweet! &#128526; Next week you'll get to create a class template of your own!
	</p>
	<p>This class template stuff and using map is all good. But there is one big problem. The C-type array could have many bottles of any specific type of medication. Maps use keys to look up a single value. Oh no...now we can only have one bottle of each type of medication in the pharamcy. Don't worry. There is a solution...
	</p>
	<h1>Lists</h1>
	<p>
		Lists are containers that are very good at keeping a group of items in a specific order. They are also good at adding and removing additional elements at the beginning or end of the list, O(1). Since you've learned about and used lists before, draw on that experience to understand what you're reading next. 
	</p>
	<p>The pharmacy needs to be able to have multiple bottles of each type of medication. We know we can use a map with the name of the medication as a key to do a fast lookup. What if instead of looking up a single bottle the map could look up a list of bottles? Then the <span class="file_name">PharmaceuticalStockModel</span> class would be fast and flexible. That's a good design! &#127881; To make this happen all the map needs is a key of type string and a value that is a list of medications, <span class="file_name">list&lt;Medication&gt;</span>. The complete, fast, flexible change is now,
	</p>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">class PharmaceuticalStockModel{
    using std::string;
    using std::map;
    using std::list;
    private:
        map&lt;string,list&lt;Medication&gt;&gt; in_stock_medications;
    public:
    /*
     * constructor and class function declarations here
     */
        void add_tablet_to_stock(const TabletMedication& medication_to_add);
 }
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
		There is another benefit of this design. If bottles of medication are always added at the end of the list for their type of medication. The medication purchased longest ago will always be at the front of the list. That way, when a perscription for some amount of medication is recieved, the bottle purchased longest ago is the one that will be used to fill the perscription. That guarentees the stock of that medication will get turned over appropriately, assuming there is a correlation between the dates the medications were received and the expiration date of the medication in the bottles.
	</p>
	<p>
		What, then, would the code for the <span class="file_name">PharmaceuticalStockModel</span> instance function <span class="file_name">add_tablet_to_stock</span> look like that adds a tablet-type medication to an existing list for that medication stored in the map? To pull this off, there is one more tool you need...
	</p>
	<h2>Iterators</h2>
	<p>
		<dfn>iterate: </dfn><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iterate">to say or do again or again and again.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		<dfn>Iterators</dfn> are instances of classes that let you move through a container of elements. Like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp">Python lists</a>, all C++ standard containers have one or more instance functions that return iterators. So for example, if you had the list of integers, list&lt;int&gt;ages{1,17,5,23}, you could get an iterator to the beginning of the list, the end of the list, or somewhere in between. But, unlike Python iterators, you have to use an operator in order to get the value out of the iterator.
	</p>
	<h3>Get the Beginning of the List</h3>
		<p><pre><code class="C++">list&lt;int&gt;ages{1,17,5,23}
auto front_age_iterator = ages.begin();
cout &lt;&lt; *front_age_iterator&lt;&lt;endl;//prints out 1
</code>
	</pre></p>

	<h3>Get the End of the List</h3>
		<p><pre><code class="C++">list&lt;int&gt;ages{1,17,5,23}
auto end_age_iterator = ages.end();
cout &lt;&lt; *end_age_iterator&lt;&lt;endl;//prints out 23
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h3>Find Some Place in the List</h3>

	<p><pre><code class="C++">list&lt;int&gt;ages{1,17,5,23}
auto front_age_iterator = ages.begin();
auto back_age_iterator = ages.end();
//find the location of 5 in the list...search from the list's beginning to its end
auto found_age_iterator = ages.find(ages.begin(),ages.end(),5);
</code>
	</pre></p>

	<h3>Moving Using Iterators</h3>
	<p>
		To move to the next element of the list you use the ++ operator, a reflection of the sibling relationship C++ has with C.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="C++">list&lt;int&gt;ages{1,17,5,23}
auto front_age_iterator = ages.begin();
cout &lt;&lt; *front_age_iterator&lt;&lt;endl;//prints out 1
front_age_iterator++;
cout &lt;&lt; *front_age_iterator&lt;&lt;endl;//prints out 17
</code>
	</pre></p>
	<h3>Bringing it All Together</h3>
	<p>
	Now, combining a map that uses a string for its keys and a list of medications as its value, the <span class="file_name">add_tablet_to_stock</span> method can now be done. Compare these next sentences with the code example below.</p>
	<p> First, use the map's find method to get an iterator that contains the list of medications with the name of the medication as the key. The iterator for this map Has_A private key-value pair of type <span class="file_name">std::pair&lt;string, list&lt;Medication&gt;&gt;</span>. Since the list is the second element of the pair, use the public <span class="file_name">second</span> instance variable of the pair to access the list containing all the bottles of medication. Lastly, use the list's <span class="file_name">push_back</span> method to add the medication to the end of the list...and you're done. The medication has been added.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is the code that is that series of steps. Take a good, long, look. Spend a good amount of time. Think about it. Ponder it. Talk about it with other members of the class. Ask your teacher about it. This is very important code.
	</p>
<p><pre><code class="C++">void PharmaceuticalStockModel::add_tablet_to_stock(const TabletMedication& medication_to_add){
	auto found_medication_iterator = in_stock_medications.find(medication_to_add.get_name());
	found_medication_iterator->second.push_back(medication_to_add);
}
</code>
	</pre></p>
