      <h1>Week 2 Ponder and Prove: First C++ Program</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Task: Write a console-based calculator program that works with a series of integers.</p>
      <p>Purpose: Learn to write C++ programs.</p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>You will create a console-based calculator program that will accept a series of integers entered by the
         user, then display the sum, average, min, and max. The program will first prompt the user for the number of
         integers they will be entering. Then prompt the user for each number, one at a time. The program will then
         calculate the sum, average, min, and max for the given numbers and display the result on the console. See an
         example run of the program below (user input is found after the colon).
      </p>
      <pre><code class="console">
How many numbers? <span class="underline">5</span>
Number 1: 1
Number 2: 5
Number 3: 7
Number 4: 8
Number 5: 9

Sum: 30
Average: 6
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 9
      </code></pre>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Store the numbers entered by the user in an array of integers.</li>
         <li>Use <span class="file_name">unique_ptr</span> and <span class="file_name">new</span> to declare an
            array of the required size.</li>
         <li>You must use <span class="file_name">reduce</span> (<span class="file_name">accumulate</span>)
            functionality to calculate the sum, min, and max</li>
         <li>Do not use any built-in sum, min, or max functions. You must write code to calculate them yourself.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>
         After your program is working to calculate the sum, min, max, and average using the reduce functionality, now
         practice using a map function. Use the
         C++ <span class="file_name">transform</span> function on the array of numbers to square each number, storing
         the results back in the array in place of the original numbers. Use a C++ <span
            class="file_name">for_each</span> loop to display the resulting list of numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
         Next, use a filter function (<span class="file_name">remove_if</span>) to find all numbers in the
         array of squares that are less than 1000. Use a <span class="file_name">for_each</span> loop to display these
         numbers on the console.
      </p>
      <p>
         Finally, use the <span class="file_name">remove_if</span> function again to find all <em>odd</em> numbers in
         the array of numbers less than 1000. This time, use a C++ <span class="file_name">for</span>
         loop. Although this type of loop is less preferred and prone to errors, you will encounter them in code written
         by others, especially in older C++ code. What do you notice when you try to use a standard <span
            class="file_name">for</span> loop? We don't know how many odd numbers were found using the <span
            class="file_name">remove_if</span> function! You'll need to do some math with <span
            class="file_name">numbers_end</span> and <span class="file_name">numbers.get()</span>
         to figure that out. Can you see why using a <span class="file_name">for_each</span> loop is a better fit for
         this problem? Display the odd
         numbers in the array using a <span class="file_name">for</span> loop.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example run of the program:
         <pre><code class="console">
How many numbers? <span class="underline">5</span>
Number 1: <span class="underline">3</span>
Number 2: <span class="underline">7</span>
Number 3: <span class="underline">16</span>
Number 4: <span class="underline">29</span>
Number 5: <span class="underline">37</span>

Sum: 92
Average: 18.4
Minimum: 3
Maximum: 37
Square of each number: 9 49 256 841 1369
Numbers less than 1000: 9 49 256 841
Odd numbers: 9 49 841
         </code></pre>
      </p>
      <h3>Hints</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Use a standard C++ <span class="file_name">for</span> loop to
            prompt for each number and insert it into the array.
         </li>
         <li>Include the <span class="file_name">algorithm</span> library for the <span
               class="file_name">transform</span>, <span class="file_name">remove_if</span>, and <span
               class="file_name">for_each</span> functions
         </li>
         <li>Include the <span class="file_name">numeric</span> library for the <span
               class="file_name">accumulate</span> function</li>
         <li>Include the <span class="file_name">memory</span> library for <span class="file_name">unique_ptr</span>
         </li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Thinking about Security</h2>
      <p>Now that you've learned to use the built-in map, filter, and reduce functionality preferred in modern C++,
         let's look at another way you could have written the code to calculate the sum, min, and max using the older
         C-type <span class="file_name">for</span> loop. Then we'll see how this type of code could lead to bugs that
         introduce a security vulnerabilities into our program.</p>

      <p>Prompt the user for five additional numbers and store them in a new array. Then write three functions to
         calculate the sum, min, and max. Each function should use a <span class="file_name">for</span> counting loop to
         iterate over each number in the array. Your three functions
         should implement the following function prototypes. Note that we must pass in the number of items in the array
         (the first parameter, <span class="file_name">count</span>) along with a reference to the array itself.
         Othewise, the function has no way of knowing how many items are in
         the array.</p>
      <pre><code>
int calc_sum(int count, const unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt;&amp; numbers);
int find_min(int count, const unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt;&amp; numbers);
int find_max(int count, const unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt;&amp; numbers);
      </code></pre>


      <p>After you have implemented each function, write some driver code in your <span class="file_name">main</span>
         function to call each of these three functions to calculate the sum, average, min, and max again.
      </p>
      <p>
         What happens if you make a mistake and pass a wrong value for <span class="file_name">count</span> to one of
         these functions? For example, if your array of numbers has 5 items, what if you accidentally pass the value 6
         as the first parameter to your <span class="file_name">calc_sum</span> function? </p>
      <p>What happens if you accidentally write a <span class="file_name">for</span> loop that counts one number too
         high so you end up trying to access an item in the numbers array that is outside the bounds of the array?</p>
