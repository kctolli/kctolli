      <h1>Week 3 Ponder and Prove: Using Classes</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Task: Implement the Customer and Account classes shown in the provided UML diagram</p>
      <p>Purpose: Learn to create C++ classes</p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Implement the classes shown in the diagram (Customer and Account). First, create a header file to contain your
         code for each class declaration. Then, create a cpp file for each class definition. You
         should end up with four files: <span class="file_name">customer.h</span>, <span
            class="file_name">customer.cpp</span>, <span class="file_name">account.h</span>, and <span
            class="file_name">account.cpp</span>.
         <img src="images/cse220c_week03_prove_uml.svg" alt="UML diagram showing Customer and Account classes. 
         Customer - Properties: given_name:string, family_name:string, id:int Methods: Customer(id:int, given_name:string, family_name:string) 
         get_name()const:string, get_id():const:string.
         Account - properties: account_number:int, balance:double, owner:Customer. Methods: Account(account_number:int, owner:Customer) 
         Account(account_number:int, owner:Customer, opening_balance:double) get_account_num():const int get_balance():const double 
         set_balance(double):void get_owner_name():const string get_owner_id():const int deposit(double):void withdraw(double):void">
      </p>
      <p>Do not use pass-by-value for the <span class="file_name">Customer</span> object in the <span
            class="file_name">Account</span> constructor. We
         don't want to create a copy of
         a <span class="file_name">Customer</span>. Instead, we want to pass a reference to the <span
            class="file_name">Customer</span>, so we need to use the C++ pass-by-reference
         mechanism. The private member variable "owner" in the <span class="file_name">Account</span> class should be a
         <span class="file_name">Customer</span> reference rather than
         a <span class="file_name">Customer</span> object.
      </p>
      <p>The <span class="file_name">get_name()</span> member function of the <span class="file_name">Customer</span>
         class should return a string
         composed of the given name and
         family name concatenated together with a space in between. For example, if the given name is "John" and the
         family name is "Smith", the <span class="file_name">get_name()</span> function should return the string "John
         Smith".
      </p>
      <p>You should include the == operator in each class declaration and implementation.
      </p>
      <p>After you have created the <span class="file_name">Customer</span> and <span class="file_name">Account</span>
         class definitions, create a file
         called <span class="file_name">main.cpp</span> and write a
         simple driver program in the <span class="file_name">main()</span> function to test your classes. Create an
         instance of the <span class="file_name">Account</span> class and
         test each public method. You will need to create an instance of the <span class="file_name">Customer</span>
         class before creating an <span class="file_name">Account</span>.
         You should also test each public method of the <span class="file_name">Customer</span> class.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example of what your driver program output might look like:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="console">
Creating a customer...
Customer ID: 100
Name: John Smith

Creating an account...
Account Number: 12345
Account Owner: John Smith
Account Owner ID: 100
Account balance: 0

Creating an account with an opening balance...
Account Number: 67890
Account balance: 500.25
Depositing 25.00...
New account balance: 525.25
Withdrawing 25.00...
New account balance: 500.25
      </code></pre>


      <h2>Thinking about Security</h2>
      <p>Now that your <span class="file_name">Customer</span> and <span class="file_name">Account</span> classes have
         been implemented, take a moment
         to think about what could go
         wrong. Consider these situations:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            What will happen if you pass a negative number to the deposit method?
         </li>
         <li>
            What if you pass a negative number to the withdraw method?
         </li>
         <li>
            What if you withdraw an amount greater than the balance of the account?
         </li>
         <li>
            What if you deposit an amount greater than can be held by a double?
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Consider the implications of these questions. Then go back to your driver program and try each of these
         situations. Is the result what you expected? What do you need to add to your code to address these questions?
         Can you think of any other potential bugs or security vulnerabilities with your code?
      </p>

      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>After completing the instructions:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Review one of the many <a href="instructor_solution.html">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
         <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solution's code, and</li>
         <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
      </ol>
