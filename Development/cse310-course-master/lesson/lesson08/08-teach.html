	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You need to meet at least once together as a team this week.  Your recommended agenda is as follows:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Opening Prayer</p></li>
        <li><p>Each team member should report on their assignments.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make assignments for team members to continue implementing different parts of the software.  You should refer to the schedule that your team wrote in the project plan.  Remember that all team members should be writing code.</p></li>
        <li><p>Discuss technical risks and team concerns together and make plans to resolve them.</p></li>
        <li><p>Complete the Team Status Report (see below) as a team.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You may need to refer back to the <a href="../modules/team_project_description.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a>.</p>
