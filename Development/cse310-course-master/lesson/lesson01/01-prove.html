		<h1>W01 Prove: Create Personal Software Portfolio</h1>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <h3>What is a Portfolio?</h3>
		
		<p>It is often said that if a person wants to become a great piano player, then that person needs to practice the piano.  The same can be said for a computer programmer.  It is not enough for a student of programming to implement the problem sets given to them during their academic experience.  When we interview for a job, the potential employer will be interested in what we have created that is unique from other students.  Usually, the best thing to discuss is relevant employment.  However, if we are seeking our first job or if we are seeking a job that requires new technical skills, we will need to have something to discuss and showcase.  A personal software portfolio is a collection of our creative software work.  This portfolio does not contain the solutions to problems that all of our peers solved in previous classes.  Rather, this portfolio contains the results of our scientfic experimentation with technology.  We should reflect on the scientific process, as shown below:</p>

The process goes: Problem Statement, Research, Hypothesis, Experiment, and then Conclusions.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is solved, then we can finish, knowing we have the answer.  If the conclusions suggest that the problem is not solved, then we return back up to the Research step."/>
        <figcaption>Scientific Method</figcaption></figure>
        
        <p>Our portfolio should contain all the software we have created in our effort to either learn new technologies or solve new problems.  The code by itself is insufficient when we consider the scientific method; the portfolio must represent the research and conclusions that we have obtained through the process.  Each piece of software that we include within our portfolio must have documentation. The documentation serves many purposes, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Potential employers will understand the purpose and scope of our software, including the breadth of knowledge that we have regarding the subject.</p></li>
        <li><p>Other engineers can learn from our work and potentially collaborate with us on improvements.</p></li>
        <li><p>We can recall where we stopped our investigation so that later we can continue with our learning.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Creating a Portfolio</h3>
        <p>The software we put in our portfolio must be suitable for sharing with everyone.  Solutions to specific academic problems and proprietary solutions from our company should not be included.  In this course, however, we will be asked to create content that is very appropriate for our portfolio.  Everything that we create in this course will be required to be shared in a public repository.  The Prove assignment this week will be to establish a well-documented GitHub account.  Once our account is established, we will create and add our first piece of software, demonstrating a programming language that we already know.  In addition to publishing our code, we will also publish detailed documentation (as a README.md file).</p>
        <p>Putting code into GitHub requires the use of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank">Git</a> program.  Visual Studio Code will both detect your Git installation and provide integration.  This <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_zyyx43ke" target="_blank">GitHub Workshop video</a> will walk through the process of creating a “Hello World” program using Python and Visual Studio Code and publishing it within GitHub.  You can also read more from these websites:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol" target="_blank">Using Version Control in VS Code&mdash;Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github" target="_blank">Working with GitHub in VS Code&mdash;Microsoft</a> (official website)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The use of Visual Studio Code is recommended for most modules in this course.  However, you are allowed to use other Integrated Development Environments (IDE).  In some modules, you will be guided to use other tools that are better suited for the task.  You will need to learn how to integrate with GitHub when other tools are used.</p>
		
        <h2 style="counter-reset: h3">Assignment</h2>
        
        <p>Throughout this course you will be adding several pieces of software into your Personal Software Portfolio.  In this assignment, you will add you first one (Helllo World) to make sure you understand the process.  The <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_zyyx43ke" target="_blank">GitHub Workshop video</a> will walk you through this assignment using Python.  </p>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Create a GitHub account by applying for the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>.  The Student Developer Pack can be applied to existing GitHub accounts as well.</p></li>
        <li><p>Edit your profile to include a picture, name and brief bio (for example, “Computer Science Student at BYU-Idaho”).</p></li>
        <li><p>Using Visual Studio Code, write a very simple "Hello World" program in any programming language that you already know.  You are encouraged to complete this program in Python.  The code should be placed in its own folder.</p> </li>
        <li><p>Download the following <a href="../modules/psp/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file and put it in the same folder as your code.  You always want to put this file at the top of your folder structure so it will be displayed automatically in GitHub.</p></li>
        <li><p>The README.md file you received is a template written in Markdown language.  You need to fill it out completely.  Refer to the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown Language Cheatsheet</a> for help with the syntax.  This file will be publically viewable in GitHub so make sure has good spelling and grammar and is professional.</p>
        <li><p>The README.md file will require that you provide a YouTube link to a video about the software you created.  Create a one minute video that provides a demo of your software and walkthrough of the code.  Future videos you do for other modules will be longer.  The video should be published in YouTube.  Use the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407" target="_blank">YouTube Upload Videos</a> support page if you need additional instructions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Publish your code (with the README.md) into a public GitHub repository.  You will need to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank">git</a> to give Visual Studio Code that capability to publish to GitHub.</p></li>
        <li><p>Download the <a href="cse310_personal_software_portfolio.docx" target="_blank">cse310_personal_software_portfolio.docx</a> to provide the link to the public repository you created.  There is a checklist in the template that you should complete to ensure that everything has been completed.</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Rubric</h3>
        
        <p>Your first repository will be graded using the following rubric using a 50 point scale:</p>
        <table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Criteria</th>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Points</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>The Hello World program was put into a public GitHub repository.</td>
			  <td>30</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>The README.md file has been populated from the correct template and well documents the software created.</td>
			  <td>10</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
			  <td>The video has been created and well documents the software created.</td>
			  <td>10</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
