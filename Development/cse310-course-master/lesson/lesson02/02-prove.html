        <h2>Reading and Activities</h2>
        
		<p>The “Finding a Job” readings in this course will all come from the Self Reliance Services (SRS) <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/ldsorg/topics/self-reliance/find-a-better-job-na-eng.pdf" target="_blank">“Find a Better Job” manual</a> published by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  You should download this manual for use in this course.  You will complete a reading and a Prove assignment related to employment every other week.</p>
        
        <p>The SRS manual is intended for use in a group, but you will use it individually.  Activities and discussions in the reading should be done individually.</p>
        
        <p>This week, you should complete the following reading:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Introduction, Page 25</p></li>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Section 1—How People Really Get Jobs, Page 26</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>You should watch the video <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2016-12-0002-how-jobs-are-really-filled" target="_blank">How Jobs Are Really Filled</a> referenced in this section.</p></li>
            <li><p>In the activity, after you make the list of potential contacts within 60 seconds, share with a friend or family member and ask for some sources or specific names you may have missed.</p></li>
            </ul>
        <li><p>Chapter 2, Section 2—Talk to Everyone, Pages 27–29</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additionally, spend a few minutes looking at the networking resources at the <a href="https://www.byui.edu/career-center">BYU-Idaho Career Center</a>.</p> 
        
        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        
        <p>During the reading from the SRS manual “Find a Better Job,” you completed an activity where you made a list of potential contacts you could network with to find employment opportunities.  Your assignment this week is to expand this list to 20 potential contacts.</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><p>Download the <a href="cse310_networking.docx">cse310_networking.docx</a> template.</p></li>
        <li><p>Starting with the list you created during the reading activity, create a list of 20 potential contacts you could network with to find employment opportunities.  For each contact, include a description of who they are (for example: former co-worker, teacher, former youth leader, relative, friend already employed).</p></li>
        </ol>
