		<h1>Team Project Description</h1>
        
        <h2>Your Team</h2>
        
        <p>You have been placed into a team with other students.&nbsp;The purpose of this team is to do three things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Demonstrate your individual ability to contribute, communicate, and resolve conflicts with other students.</p></li>
        <li><p>Facilitate the requirement to develop a larger project using one or more of the discovery modules in this course.</p></li>
        <li><p>Provide an opportunity to share your own ideas, experiences, and conclusions with other students.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
                
        <p>Your team will propose a software project to complete over the remaining weeks of this course.  The project should have the following characteristics:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create educational software for an elementary or secondary student (e.g. pre college grades, K-12).</p></li>
            <li><p>Create one of the following:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Android Mobile App using either Java or Kotlin</p></li>
                    <li><p>Web App using Django and Python</p></li>
                    <li><p>Game using Python with either the Arcade or PyGame library</p></li>
                </ul>
            <li><p>The project should store relevant data in either a SQL Relational Database, Cloud Database, or within a file.</p></li>
            <li><p>The project should be large enough to provide a challenge over the remaining weeks of the course.&nbsp;However, the project should not be so large that it cannot be accomplished.</p></li>
            </li>
            <li><p>The project must be configured in a public GitHub repository with a well-documented README.md file.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        
        <p>The schedule for the team project is as follows:</p>
        
        <table>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 25%">Course Week</th><th style="width: 75%">Activity</th></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>Create Team Contract</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>Create Project Plan (includes proposal)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5-12</td><td>Work on project and submit a weekly team status report (I-Learn quiz)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>13</td><td>Provide a demo of the project and submit</td></tr>            
        </table>
        
        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        
        <p>You may feel frustrated that your grade in this course is dependent on other people. However, you must realize that your success in a career, including your ability to provide for your families and build Zion in your communities, will rely directly upon the performance of you and others. While the penalties in college are restricted to grades, the penalties in the workforce will include the loss of trust and employment.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><p>The team must meet at least once per week. Each team member must commit to attending all team meetings. If there is an emergency that prevents you from attending a team meeting, then you must notify your team. Failure to attend team meetings regularly will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to attend team meetings regularly will reduce the ability of the team to succeed.</p></li>
        <li><p>This is a programming class. Each team member must commit to developing an equal amount of code on the project. It is not acceptable to have a team member focus on non-software activities only. Failure to do your equal share of coding will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to do your equal share of coding will reduce the ability of the team to succeed.</p></li>
        <li><p>You must dedicate the required time each week to complete all the required activities which you have committed to in your life. It is important that you balance your schedule so none of these activities is sacrificed. Failure to dedicate time for your team project will result in a lower individual grade. Additionally, failure to dedicate time for your team project will reduce the ability for the team to succeed.  These committments includes the following:</p></li>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Assignments given to you in your team (about 4–5 hours a week)</p></li>
            <li><p>Completion of individual modules in the course (about 4–5 hours a week)</p></li>
            <li><p>Completion of other courses you are taking this semester</p></li>
            <li><p>Family commitments</p></li>
            <li><p>Work commitments</p></li>
            <li><p>Church commitments</p></li>
            </ul>                
        <li><p>You must recognize if you are getting overwhelmed with work in your life. It is important to speak to your spouse, a family member, a friend, a team member, your teacher, a counselor, or a church leader if you find yourself having difficulty. Failure to talk to others when you are struggling may result in difficulty keeping other commitments, including personal commitments. Your emotional health is just as important as your spiritual and physical health. You must be proactive and ask for help.</p></li>
        <li><p>A successful team is built upon the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. You are expected to individually do your part to ensure that the Holy Ghost is included in all your team’s work. Consistent team and individual prayer is essential to invite the Spirit into your work. Consider the following scriptures frequently as you work together:</p></li>

        <h2>Rubric</h2>
        
        <p>Your team project will be given a team grade according to the following rubric using a 100 point scale:</p>
        
        <table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Criteria</th>
