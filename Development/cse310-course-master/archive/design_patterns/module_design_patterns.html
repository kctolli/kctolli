		<h1>Design Patterns</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Overview of Design Patterns</p>
        
		<p>You can read more on sites such as the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><p><a href="" target="_blank"></a> ()</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>Your are strongly encouraged to use the Guidance section below when implementing these requirements.  You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write <strong>three separate</strong> programs that demonstrate <strong>three separate</strong> design patterns.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>You may use any programming language.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Each program should perform a useful task.  The programs should be interesting and complex enough so that you will be excited to share them with potential employers and co-workers.  In general, each program should be at least fifty lines of code.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Each program should be of your own creation and not the result of completing an online tutorial.  Using tutorials is a good way to learn but you should follow this up with the creation of your work.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Ensure you code is well documented with comments.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
        
            <p>Use the following <a href="">README.md</a> template to create your documentation for your public GitHub repository.  It is important that you complete all sections of the template before submiting your module.</p>
        
            <p>In your README.md file, you will need provide a link to a YouTube video that introduces your softare, demos the execution of the software, and walksthrough the code.  Your video should be 3-4 minutes in length.</p>
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing a fourth program that implements an additional design pattern.</p>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <p>You are encouraged to implement your code in an object oriented language such as Java, Python, or C++.</p>
        
        <p>The following design patterns are good ones to consider demonstrating: </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p></p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Here are some good language specific websites for learning about design patterns:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p></p></li>
        </ul>

		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        <!-- Update based on the README.md template and requirements -->        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
