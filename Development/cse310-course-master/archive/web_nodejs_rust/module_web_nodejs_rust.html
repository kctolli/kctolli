		<h1>Discovery Module—Web Sites using NodeJS and Rust</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>From the article <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">What Is Rust And Why Is It So Popular?</a>, we read that Rust has been on Stackoverflow's most loved languages list for years and that it solves many pain points of other programming languauges. It is growing quickly and has incredible potential in many different fields. </p>
		<p>Likewise, with more than a billion downloads, Node.js is growing at an incredible rate. It thrives in building real-time applications, the Internet of Things, and microservices. Many advantages of using Node.js can be read about here: <a href="https://www.monterail.com/blog/nodejs-development-enterprises">6 Reasons Why You Should Use Node.js for Enterprise-Level Organizations</a>.</p>
		<p>Considering these two things, this module is meant to build your expertise in both of these areas. In the blog post <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/rust-and-node-js-a-match-made-in-heaven/">Rust and Node.js: A Match Made in Heaven</a>, Anshul Goyal explains:</p>
		<div style="margin-left:40px; font-size:85%;">
			<p><em>“Node.js is a very popular JavaScript runtime for writing backend applications. Its flexibility and nonblocking nature have made it the premier choice for API consumption.</em></p>
			<p><em>“Since it is a scripting language, JavaScript can be pretty slow. But thanks to V8 optimization, it is fast enough for practical applications. That said, Node.js is not good for heavy lifting; since it’s single-threaded, it is dangerous to block the main thread for doing long calculations. That’s where worker threads come in. Node.js has support for worker threads, so it can be used to perform long calculations.</em></p>
			<p><em>“As great as worker threads are, JavaScript is still slow. Moreover, worker threads are not available in all supported LTS versions of Node. Fortunately, we can use Rust to build a native add-on for Node.js. FFI is another alternative, but it’s slower than the add-on approach. Rust is blazing fast and has fearless concurrency. Since Rust has a very small runtime (or “not runtime”), our binary size should also be pretty small.”</em></p>
		</div>	
		<p>Overall, there are many reasons to consider using Rust in a Node.js project. As mentioned above, Rust is able to perform heavy tasks with extreme efficiency and security. While most tasks you could technically perform with Node.js, many will perform much better with Rust because of the CPU-intensive processing they require. Some examples include cryptography, image processing, video processing, or anything that utilizes a lot of data. For example, several large apps that perform complex tasks in programming languages similar to Rust are Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p>

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Node.JS Application</strong> </p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>To get started with Node.js, you may want to follow this tutorial: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial">Node.js Tutorial in Visual Studio Code</a>. Alternatively, you can start on the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js install page</a>. </p></li> 
					<li><p>Download <a href="./nodejs_template.zip">nodejs_template.zip</a> as a base for your web application.</p></li>
					<li><p>Inspect the code and run it. Begin to think about ways you could build an application that would effectively utilize Rust. </p></li>
					<li><p>Your web application must contain at least one page and should effectively utilize Rust. </p></li>
					<li><p>It should do something beneficial and be useful enough that someone would want to use it. </p></li>
					<li><p>You are not required to push this project to the cloud to complete this module. You can develop and complete it locally (localhost) and submit a ZIP file upon completion.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>Rust Module</strong> 
				</p>
				<ul>
						<li><p>Incorporate a Rust module into this application.</p></li>
						<li><p>This can be a simple module, but should complement your Node application. </p></li>
						<li><p>To get started with Rust, go to <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust's Getting Started page</a>. Be sure to view the guidance resources below as well.</p></li>
					</ul>
			</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
			<p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
					<li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
					<li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
					<li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
				</ul>
		
		<h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		<p>After your complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            	<li><p>Deploy this application to the cloud so that anyone can view it with the URL.</p></li>
		<li><p>Incorporate a database such as Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to save application data.</p></li>
		<li><p>Incorporate threading into the Rust module.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>

		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
