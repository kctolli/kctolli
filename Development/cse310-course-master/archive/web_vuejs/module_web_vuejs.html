<h1>Discovery Module - Progressive Web Apps with VueJS</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>There are many different types of applications: desktop apps, mobile apps, web apps, and many others. Many companies will expend great effort to build a web application, and then expend close to the same level of effort to develop a mobile or desktop application for their customers to use. This is often done because there are many capabilities that native apps have that websites simply cannot have, such as working with file systems, or using device functionalities such as haptic feedback or push notifications. </p>
  <p>A progressive web app is built using web technologies, but acts and feels like a native app on a mobile device. For companies or developers needing to develop software for both the web and mobile/desktop apps, progressive web apps can save an incredible amount of time and money in the short and long term. This is because, even after deployment, apps will be easier to maintain and update across the board. Alex Russell, who coined the term <em>progressive web app,</em> said, "Progressive web apps are just websites that took all the right vitamins."</p>

</ul>

<h2>Module Requirements</h2>

<p>To complete this module, you need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
      <li><p>Learn how to create a web application using Vue.js</p></li>
      <li><p>Deploy this application as a PWA (progressive web app)</p></li>
      <li><p>The app that you create should do the following:</p></li>
          <ul>
              <li><p>Have a professional look and feel</p></li>
              <li><p>Accomplish something meaningful</p></li>
              <li><p>Be able to be installed on the operating system of your computer (MacOS, Windows or Linux)</p></li>
              <li><p>Be able to be installed on the operating system of your mobile device (Android or iOS)</p></li>
          </ul>
      
      <li><p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal programming portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p></li>
          <ul>
              <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
              <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
              <li><p>How to build (if applicable), execute, and use your program. This includes any settings that a user would have to modify to allow the installation of a PWA on their devices.</p></li>
              <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
              <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
          </ul>
</ul>
  
          
<h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>

<p>You can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><p>Incorporate the necessary flags and code to be able to use the camera of a mobile device and view a new picture in the app. </p></li>
      <li><p>Incorporate a data layer such as Firebase to save data from your application.</p></li>
      <li><p>Modify the desktop version of this application to access and modify the file system of the computer it is installed on.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>

<h2>Guidance</h2>

<p>There are many different ways that you could go about building this application. At a minimum, you will be required to use Vue.js and a PWA for this module. Here are some helpful resources to get started with these technologies:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy9q22isx3U"  target="_blank">Vue JS Crash Course (Youtube)</a></p></li>
   <li><p><a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-ultimate-guide-to-progressive-web-applications"  target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide to Progressive Web Applications</a></p></li>
   <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Yr-J4X34M&feature=youtu.be"  target="_blank">Master PWA in Vue - JavaScript Marathon (Youtube)</a></p></li>
   <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSr2vBApSI"  target="_blank">STATE & STORE | VueJS & Vuex | Learning the Basics (Youtube)</a></p></li>
   
   
</ul>
<p>Additionally, depending on the stretch challenge(s) you want to embark on, you may need to look into Firebase tutorials such as these:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/firebase-101-realtime-database-58f975033e01" target="blank">Firebase 101: Realtime Database</a></p></li>

</ul>
<p>Lastly, when working with the native functionality of devices, these resources may be helpful to you:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR97Uq2Ejks"  target="_blank">How to create a CAMERA APP in VueJS </a></p></li>

<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
  
<table>
   <tr>
     <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
     <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>100 (A)</td>
     <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should consider adding additional functionality to further expand your knowledge.</td>
   </tr>	
   <tr>
     <td>89 (B+)</td>
     <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
   </tr>	
   <tr>
     <td>75 (C)</td>
     <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>60 (D-)</td>
     <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
   </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0 (F)</td>
        <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
      </tr>
</table>
  
  <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
