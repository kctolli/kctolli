		<h1>Discovery Moduleâ€”Creating an Android App</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Did you know that there are close to three million applications in the Google Play Store? Did you also know that the average Android developer makes well over <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/android-developer/salaries" target="_blank">$100k/year</a>? Android is everywhere, and the ability to make Android applications has never been more sought after or desirable than it is now. Android applications are typically written in Java or Kotlin using Android Studio, and while many applications are published to the Google Play Store or other application markets, developers are able to create applications and distribute them without such deployments. This module is intended for you to learn how to develop Android applications quickly.</p>
		<p>You can read more from sites such as the following:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_software_development" target="_blank">Android Apps - Wikipedia</a> (reference site)</p></li>
				<li><p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> (official site)</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        <ul>
				<li><p>Create a native Android application using Android Studio (using Java or Kotlin)</p></li>
				<li><p>This application should do the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Have at least one screen</p></li>
                        <li><p>Be interactive with the user</p></li>
						<li><p>Be helpful in performing a task that you, or someone you know, do on a frequent basis</p></li>                       <li><p>Run successfully on an Android device (or on an emulator)</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        
            <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
			  <li><p>Use something in Android that requires permission (for example: location, camera, microphone, etc.)</p></li>
			  <li><p>Incorporate multiple screens or activities</p></li>
           <li><p>Store data either in local storage (files or shared preferences)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
        
		<h2 style="counter-reset: h3">Guidance</h2>
		<p>You should consider using Android Studio and either Java or Kotlin (depending on which language you know best). The app should run on an Android phone.  If you don't have an Android phone, you can use the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator" target="_blank">emulator</a> provided within Android Studio.  Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when creating an Android app:</p>

		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
