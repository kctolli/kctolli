		<h1>Discovery Module—Web Sites using Django</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Django is a Python library that is used to create a web app with dynamically generated websites.  When a request is made to your web app, the Django framework will call the appropriate Python code (a function in your <code>views.py</code>) file).  The Python code will then parse the request and prepare a response.  To prepare a response, your code might read a database, download some data from another web server, or perform some calculations.  To produce the response, a template HTML file is populated with data created by the Python function.  The response is then automatically sent back by the Django framework.  Using a framework can reduce the time it takes to create web content.  In the case of Django, you also have the benefit of using the Python programming language to process requests.

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
		<ul>
            <li><p>Write a Web App that has at least four web pages using Python and Django.   Each of the four web pages should be represented by a Python function in the <code>views.py</code> file.  In summary, your app should support at least the following URL's when running on your local machine with the default port:</p>            </li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_1</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_2</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_3</p></li>
                <li><p>http://127.0.0.1:8000/app_name/page_name_4</p></li>
                </ul>

            <li><p>The purpose of the program is up to you. The web sites should take inputs from the user and provide a response based on those inputs.  The task that is performed should be meaningful.</p></li>
            <li><p>The web app should run on your local computer using the built-in web server provided by Django.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
            <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create a database (such as a model) using Django and have your web pages read and write from it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use sessions in Django to remember user data with cookies.</p></li>
            <li><p>Deploy your Web App on a web server like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/" target="_blank">Glitch</a>.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>For this module, you must use Python and Django.  In addition to the tutorials in the overview section above, the following notes may be useful to you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You can use pip to install Django: <code>pip install Django</code></p></li>
            <li><p>Django projects have several files which do not need to be manually written.  The following commands are useful:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><code>django-admin startproject my_project_name</code>—This will create the initial project files</p></li>
                <li><p><code>python manage.py startapp my_app_name</code>—This will create an app in your project</p></li>
                <li><p><code>python manage.py runserver</code>—This will start your web app.  You will need to open a web browser to open the web pages.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
