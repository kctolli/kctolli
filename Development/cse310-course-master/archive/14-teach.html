		<h1>W14 Teach: Team Project</h1>
        
	    <h2>Team Meeting</h2>
        
        <p>You do not need a team meeting this week.  You should coordinate together to finish the project as needed.  There is no final group delivery.  The <a href="14-prove.html">W14 Prove</a> is an individual report that each team member will complete confidentially.  This final report will receive the grade for the project as described in the <a href="../modules/team_project_description.html" target="_blank">Team Project Description</a> rubric.  It would be helpful to remind your team members to complete their individual report before the end of the semester.</p>
        
        <p>You are also encouraged to make a copy (if the repository was not created in your account) of the project by doing a fork in GitHub (<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/" target="_blank">GitHub Forking</a>).</p>
