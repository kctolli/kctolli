        <p>This course has several modules for us to choose from to develop our programming skills (<a href="../modules/module_summary.html" target="_blank">Module Summary</a>).  Since we will have to choose two language modules and four discovery modules from the list, we will need to have a way of choosing the most appropriate ones.  To faciliate this process, we will each complete a Course Goals Survey.  The survey will help us plan which modules we should complete.  We can change our minds during the semester, but it's good to think about which modules will help us learn the most.  At the end of the course, we will take the Course Goals Survey again and observe how we have changed.</p>
        
        <p>Each module that we complete will require us to create a plan for learning the material.  The module instructions will give us an overview, requirements, guidance, and a rubric.  Several suggested websites will be given.  Detailed instructions will not be given.  Our plan will be essential for completing each module in the two weeks allowed.  Each module will also provide optional opportunities to extend our learning (for bonus points). </p>
