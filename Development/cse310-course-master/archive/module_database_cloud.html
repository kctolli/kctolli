		<h1>Discovery Module—Cloud Databases</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Cloud data storage is a convenient solution which removes the requirement for an individual or company to maintain their own database server.  Tools like <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Firebase</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> will provide you a database which you can access using an API (function calls from a library).  The use of these cloud databases is frequently free for simple projects, but will cost when scaled up.  Cloud databases provide a mix of various types of databases, including relational and key/value.  A key/value database (which is recommended in the instructions below) will store data into maps that can be queried either in whole, in parts, or in filtered parts.  A key/value database is also commonly called a NoSQL database.  The APIs for each database will vary and provide these capabilities. </p>

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
		<ul>
            <li><p>Write a program that interacts with a cloud database using NoSQL.  The purpose of the program and the type of data stored is up to you.  The program can be written in any programming language and use any cloud NoSQL database.  See the notes below for guidance about this step.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a database for your program to use.</p></li>
            <li><p>The program should demonstrate the following capabilities working with the database:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Insert new data into the database.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Modify existing data in the database.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Delete existing data from the database.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Retrieve all data from the database.</p></li>
                </ul>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        
            <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools and online accounts.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.  Remember, you should not include any passwords or keys in the documentation.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Description of the API commands you used in the program to interact with the database.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Receive notifications in your software when data in the cloud changes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Require the user of your software to create an account with your software and log in, and only display database information belonging to that user.</p></li>
            <li><p>Organize data in your database based on the user that is using the software so that only data related to that user is queried and modified.</p></li>
            <li><p>Store pictures in the database.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>You should consider using Python and Firestore (part of Google Firebase) for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Use <code>firebase-admin</code> to access a Firebase database from Python.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install firebase-admin</code></p></li> 
            <li><p>You will need to create a free Firebase account and create a Firebase Project.  </p></li>
			<li><p>During the process of getting your account and database set up, you will need to download a Service Account File, which is a JSON file.  This file along with the project name will be needed when you initialize your connection to the Firestore database within your code.  The Service Account File is secret and should not be shared in the GitHub repository.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore" target="_blank">Firestore Tutorial</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore" target="_blank">Firebase Console</a> (official site)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started" target="_blank">Google Authentication—Creating a Service Account</a> (official site)</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
