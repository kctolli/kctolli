		<h1>Language Module&mdash;Java</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The Java language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development.  Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK).  Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM.  Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading.  In Java, every file contains a single class.  A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.</p>

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write <strong>three separate</strong> programs that demonstrate the following:</p></li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>Variables</p></li>
                <li><p>Expressions</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Conditionals</p></li>                     
                <li><p>Loops</p></li>
                <li><p>Functions</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Classes</p></li>
                <li><p>Data structure from Java Collection Framework (such as ArrayList, TreeSet, and HashMap)</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><p>Each program does not need to demonstrate all the items above.  Collectively, however, the three programs should cover all the programming topics.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Each program should perform a useful task.  The programs should be interesting and complex enough so that you will be excited to share them with potential employers and co-workers.  In general, each program should be at least fifty lines of code.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>You can rewrite programs you originally wrote in a different programming language (including a previous language module for this course) to complete this module.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
           
            <p>The programs need to be published to <strong>three separate</strong> (not one) public GitHub repositories as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in <strong>each</strong> repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that reads and writes files.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that demonstrates inheritance using the <code>extends</code> and <code>abstract</code> keywords.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that uses an interface using the <code>implements</code> keyword.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <p>To set up your development environment for Java, complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Install the latest version of either <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html" target="_blank">JDK (commercial)</a> or <a href="https://jdk.java.net/" target="_blank">OpenJDK (open source)</a> from Oracle.  In industry, there are license considerations between these two options.  For your work in this course, either choice is acceptable.  Make sure that the Java compiler and virtual machine tools are in your environment path.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can either <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java" target="_blank">integrate Java into Visual Studio Code</a> or run the Java tools (javac and java) from within the Visual Studio Code terminal window.  As another option, you can use a tool like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ (free community version)</a> to develop and run Java code.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are other development environments that are provided completely online (e.g. <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>), but this module requires that you install the required development environment on your computer.  Online environments can be useful for learning.  However, demonstrating the ability to setup your environment will better prepare you for the industry.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
