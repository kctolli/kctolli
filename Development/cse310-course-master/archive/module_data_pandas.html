		<h1>Discovery Moduleâ€”Analyzing Data</h1>
        
		<h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>As the processing power of computers has increased, the world has become able to capture the large amounts of data that it produces.  Surveys, transactions, and observations are captured every hour of every day.  A data scientist has the skills to capture, organize, and analyze large amounts of data and look for patterns, trends, and statistical relevance between datasets.  Since the possibilities of data analysis are endless, programming languages are used to write customized software to analyze data.  Some languages, like R, were designed specifically for data analysis.  Libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">Scrapy</a>, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a> provide the capabilities to do the analysis with the familar Python programming language.</p>

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Find a free dataset that interests you.</p></li>
            <li><p>Identify two questions that you want to answer from the data.  You might change your questions after you explore the data further.</p></li>
            <li><p>Write a program in any programming language to analyze the dataset and provide an answer to your questions.  You may need to filter, sort, aggregate (sum, average, count), or manipulate the data to achieve your answer.  While there is no right or wrong answer, your answer should be justified by your analysis.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>

        <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
            <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
            <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
            <li><p>The source of your data, the questions you were trying to answer, and the answers you found through data analysis.</p></li>
            <li><p>Screenshots showing the results of the program that support your conclusions.</p></li>
            <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Update your software so it draws a graph showing some of the results.</p></li>
            <li><p>Find another data set similair to the one previously chosen and answer the same questions so that a comparision can be made.</p></li>
            <li><p>Identify a third question from your dataset and write code to answer it.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
    
		<p>You should consider using Python and Pandas for this module.  You should also consider using Kaggle to obtain a free dataset. Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>You need to install Pandas on your computer.  You can use pip to install: <code>pip install pandas</code>.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can download a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank">Kaggle.com</a>.  You should look for a dataset that has good documentation, which will help you understand the data.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>

		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
