		<h1>Language Module&mdash;Python</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The Python language is a high level programming language that is used for general programming.  Commonly used for analysis and simulation, Python was designed to be more approachable for non-software engineers.  Python includes support for object oriented methodologies, data structures, and threading.  Python is an interpreted language so it does not include a compiler or linker.</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write <strong>three separate</strong> programs that demonstrate the following:</p></li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>Variables</p></li>
                <li><p>Expressions</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Conditionals</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Loops</p></li>
                <li><p>Functions</p></li>   
                <li><p>Classes</p></li>
                <li><p>Data structures (e.g. list, tuple, dict, set)</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><p>Each program does not need to demonstrate all the items above.  Collectively, however, the three programs should cover all the programming topics.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Each program should perform a useful task.  The programs should be interesting and complex enough so that you will be excited to share them with potential employers and co-workers.  In general, each program should be at least fifty lines of code.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>You can rewrite the programs you wrote in a different programming language (including a previous language module for this course) to complete this module.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
           
            <p>The programs need to be published to <strong>three separate</strong> (not one) public GitHub repositories as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in <strong>each</strong> repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that reads and writes files.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that demonstrates inheritance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create or modify a program that creates multiple threads.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <p>To set up your development environment for Python, complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Install the latest version of Python 3.x from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python Downloads</a> website.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial">Python in Visual Studio Code</a>. </p></li>
        <li><p>The video provided in <a href="../../lesson01/01-prepare.html">W01 Prepare</a> showing the use of Visual Studio Code and GitHub was done using Python.  This may be a useful video to review again.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are other development environments that are provided completely online (e.g. <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>), but this module requires that you install the required development environment on your computer.  Online environments can be useful for learning.  However, demonstrating the ability to setup your environment will better prepare you for the industry.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
