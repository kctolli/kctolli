		<h1>Module—Relational Database with SQL</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Data can be stored in many different formats.  An efficient method for storing information is in a database.  One common type of database is a relational database, which organizes the data into tables and relates them together using keys.  Libraries have been written to make it easy for the programmer to read and write to and from these databases.  Most relational databases support Structured Query Language, or SQL.  SQL is a language that allows the programmer to easily interact with the database.  Examples of relational databases include the following:  <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="_blank">SQLite</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2-database" target="_blank">IBM DB2</a>.</p>
			
		<p>You can read more about relational databases and SQL at sites including the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database" target="_blank">Relational Databases - Wikipedia</a> (open collaboration site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/" target="_blank">Relational Databases - Oracle</a> (company sponsored site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/" target="_blank">SQL - W3Schools</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		<li></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Write a program that interacts with a relational database using SQL.  The purpose of the program and the type of data stored are up to you.  The program can be written in any programming language and use any relational database.  See the notes below for guidance about this step.</p></li>
		<li><p>Create a database for your program to use, including at least one table to store the data.</p></li>
		<li><p>The program should demonstrate the following capabilities working with the database:</p></li>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Insert new data into a table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Modify existing data in the table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Delete existing data from the table.</p></li>
			<li><p>Retrieve (that is, query) data from the table.</p></li>
			</ul>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        
		<p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
			<li><p>How to set up the development environment, including the database.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
			<li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
            <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
			<li><p>Description of the SQL commands you used in the program.</p></li>
			<li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
			</ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Add additional tables to your database and perform a <a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-inner-join/" target="_blank">join</a> in your software between two of the tables.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use at least two of the <a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-aggregate-functions/" target="_blank">aggregate functions</a> to summarize numerical data in your database.</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrate the use of a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
		<p>You should consider using Python and SQLite for this module.  SQLite is already support in Python by importing the sqlite3 library. </p>

        <p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/" target="_blank">SQLite Tutorial</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html" target="_blank">Python sqlite3</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm" target="_blank">TutorialsPoint: SQLIte - Python</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
