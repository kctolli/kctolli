		<h1>Language Module&mdash;Rust</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>The Rust language is used for embedded and application development.  While similair to C or C++, it has improvements including memory management and variable ownership.  Support is provided for object-oriented methodologies as well as data structures and threading.  Rust comes with a build environment called Cargo which is used both for library management and building.</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Write <strong>three separate</strong> programs that demonstrate the following:</p></li>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p>Variables (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html" target="_blank">mutable and unumutable</a>)</p></li>
                <li><p>Expressions</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Conditionals</p></li>                    
                <li><p>Loops</p></li>
                <li><p>Functions</p></li>   
                <li><p>Data structures (e.g. Vec, LinkedList, HashMap)</p></li>
                </ul>
            
            <li><p>Each program does not need to demonstrate all the items above.  Collectively, however, the three programs should cover all the programming topics.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Each program should perform a useful task.  The programs should be interesting and complex enough so that you will be excited to share them with potential employers and co-workers.  In general, each program should be at least fifty lines of code.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>You can rewrite the programs you wrote in a different programming language (including a previous language module for this course) to complete this module.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>           
            <p>The programs need to be published to <strong>three separate</strong> (not one) public GitHub repositories as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in <strong>each</strong> repository should be well-documented with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
		        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create a program or modify a program that uses a <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/rust_structure.htm" target="_blank">structure</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a program or modify a program that uses <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/rust_slices.htm" target="_blank">slicing</a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a program or modify a program that demonstrates how functions can take <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html" target="_blank">ownership or reference</a> of parameters it receives.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
		
        <p>To setup your development environment complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Install <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank">Rust</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Visual Studio Code has support for Rust.  The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust">Rust extension</a> can be installed in Visual Studio Code.  The cargo build tool can be run from the terminal.</p></li>
        <li><p>Follow chapter 1 of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html" target="_blank">Rust Programming Language Book</a> for step by step instructions for building a Hello, World application using the cargo tool.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>There are other development environments that are provided completely online (e.g. <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>), but this module requires that you install the required development environment on your computer.  Online environments can be useful for learning.  However, demonstrating the ability to setup your environment will better prepare you for the industry.</p>
		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
