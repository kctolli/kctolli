		<h1>Discovery Module—Networking</h1>
        
		<h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Communication between two computers (or even two pieces of software on the same computer) can be done using the networking stack.  A network is more than just physical wire (or wireless) that connects a computer to a network; it also includes the data that is transmitted through that connection.  The data is organized into layers according to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.  These layers include the physical, datalink, network, and transport layers.  These layers are used to package, route, and transmit data between computers.  Common transport layers include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).  On top of all of these layers is the data that we actually want to communicate to another computer.  This data is frequently organized by a message structure that both the sending computer and receiving computer understand.  Defined formats like JSON, HTML, or XML are all commonly used.</p>
            
        <p>Any information can be sent on a network connection.  Some examples include the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Collaboration system: A text message to be displayed with a message saying it was received.</p></li>
        <li><p>Problem-solving system: A request to solve a math problem like "3 + 2" with a response of "5."</p></li>
        <li><p>File-delivery system: A request that contains a filename with a response that displays the content of the file (similar to what a web browser does with a web server).</p></li>
        <li><p>Embedded system (IoT or Internet of Things): A request for temperature to a Raspberry Pi that is connected to a temperature sensor.  The response would be the temperature.  In this case, the server may have several sensors connected and the request would specify which sensor to read (e.g. "temperature," "humidity," "pressure," etc)</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When developing networking software, there are two types of models we can look at:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>Client-Server: The server receives requests from many clients, processes each one, and sends the responses back to the client.</p></li>
        <li><p>Peer-to-Peer: A computer (peer) communicates directly to another commputer without going through a server.  In this model, there may be a server that is used by a computer to get address information for the other computer.</p></li>
        </ul>

		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>

            <li><p>Write a program that allows one computer to communicate with another computer using either of the following:</p></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Client-Server Model—You will need to write one program for the client and one program for the server.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Peer-to-Peer Model—You will need to write one program for the peer to both send and receive.</p></li>
                </ul>
            <li><p>The software should implement either a collaboration system, problem solving system, file delivery system, or embedded system.  Examples of each of these systems are shown in the Overview section above.  The software may be written in any programming language.   </p></li>
            <li><p>Only one kind of request needs to be sent between computers, with the appropriate response.</p></li>
            <li><p>The program can run from the command line (no graphics needed).</p></li>
            <li><p>You can use either TCP or UDP.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
            <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program including the model (ie. client/server or peer-to-peer) and transport (ie. TCP or UDP) used.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A description of the message structure (both request and response).</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Provide support for at least three different kinds of requests that the server or the peer can respond to..</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide configuration files that are read at software initialization to define IP addresses, ports, etc.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for your program instead of the command line.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
    
		<p>You should consider using Python and standard networking libraries for this module.  Here are some useful notes when using this suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Python already has libraries to read and write from TCP and UDP sockets and servers.  See the links below for information and examples.</p></li>
            <li><p>You will need to run two programs at the same time to test your software.  It may be easier to run these programs on separate computers that have different IP addresses.  If you don't have this option, you might consider installing a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">virtual machine</a> running <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank">Linux</a>, or configuring your software to send and receive on different ports.</p></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Here is a list of websites that you might find useful when working in the suggested environment:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/socketserver.html"  target="_blank">Python Server Libraries</a> (official site)</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/socket.html"  target="_blank">Python Socket Libraries</a> (official site)</p></li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
