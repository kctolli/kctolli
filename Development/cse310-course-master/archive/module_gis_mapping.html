		<h1>Discovery Moduleâ€”GIS Mapping</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) involves the organization of information on a map.  The information can be physical (cities, landmarks, mountains, trails), economic (median incomes, tax rates, employment), social (gender, ethnicity, family, religion), or event driven (earthquake, lightning, crime, activity).  Using maps, decisions can be made, trends can be found, and information can be obtained.  The components in GIS include user interfaces, data storage, and analysis.</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>Module Requirements</h2>
		
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        
        <p>You need to complete the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Create a website that will show a base map with markers showing something that interests you.  There should be 20 or more markers.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the user clicks on a marker, the website should display information about the marker.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documentation</h3>            
            <p>The program needs to be published to a public GitHub repository as part of your personal software portfolio.  Be careful not to include any passwords or keys in your published material.  Ensure that the repository has a good description and is tagged appropriately.  The README.md file in your repository should be well-documented, with at least the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>A description of your program.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to set up the development environment, including all tools.  Provide detailed steps so that you or another engineer could replicate the environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>How to build, execute, and use your program as applicable for your development environment.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Screenshots of your software running.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A description of where you obtained the data to put on the map.</p></li>
                    <li><p>A list of useful websites that you found to assist your development work.</p></li>
                </ul>
        
                
        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
		
		<p>After you complete the module requirements, you can earn additional bonus points by completing one of the following stretch challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Obtain data automatically from a server publically available on the internet so that your website is always up to date.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide a filter in the website to allow the user to display only some of the markers.</p></li>
            <li><p>Include more than one type of data on your map (with different marker graphics).</p></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The implementation of a stretch challenge must be done within the same GitHub repository, and reflected in the descriptions found in your README.md file.</p>
        
        <p>You may not be awarded bonus points if the module requirements were not completed satisfactorily.</p>
		
		<h2>Guidance</h2>
    
		<p>You should consider using JavaScript and ArcGIS for this module.  ArcGIS offers many detailed tutorials for different programming languages.  Here is a list of websites that you might find useful:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/browse/?product=javascript&topic=any"  target="_blank">ArGIS JavaScript Tutorial&mdash;ArcGIS</a> (official site)</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js" target="_blank">JavaScript&mdash;W3Schools</a> (tutorial site)</p></li>
		</ul>

		
		<h2>Grading Rubric</h2>
        
		<p>This module will be graded as follows, with only five possible numeric grades (there is no scale):</p>
        
		<table>
			<tr>
			  <th style="width: 25%">Grade</th>
			  <th style="width: 75%">Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>100 (A)</td>
			  <td>Module is mastered, implementing all module requirements correctly with a detailed and professional README.md file in GitHub.  A potential employer would likely be interested in discussing this with you if it was relevant to the job opening.  You are encouraged to continue to maintain your software to both improve and add new functionality.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>89 (B+)</td>
			  <td>Module is well-understood, implementing most module requirements correctly, <strong>OR</strong> your README.md file may lack detail.  A potential employer might be interested in discussing this with you during a job interview if it was relevant to the job opening.  You should look for opportunities to improve your software and documentation.</td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
			  <td>75 (C)</td>
			  <td>Module is partially understood, implementing some module requirements correctly.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			  <td>60 (D-)</td>
			  <td>Module was attempted but not understood.  A potential employer would likely not be interested.  You should continue to improve this software before sharing with a potential employer.</td>
			</tr>
            <tr>
              <td>0 (F)</td>
              <td>Module was not submitted.</td>
            </tr>
		</table>
        
        <p>Up to a 10% bonus can be achieved by completing one of the stretch challenges.  Additional bonus points are not given for doing multiple stretch challenges.  However, you will improve your personal software portfolio if you continue to set aside time to develop new functionality.</p>
