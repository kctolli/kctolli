    "## Format of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are used in programming to group statements to **perform a task**.  What the task does is up to the programmer.  One of the first steps that a programmer does when starting a software program is to define as many of the tasks that exist in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format of a function in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def functionName(arguments):\n",
    "    \"\"\" Function Description \"\"\"\n",
    "    statement(s)\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of a function (From above):\n",
    "\n",
    "**def**\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions must start with the key work \"def\".  This tells Python that this will be a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**functionName**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions need a meaningful name.  Parentheses are required after the name, followed by a colon. If possible (if not always), give a function an \"action\" name.  Notice that when a name has multiple words in it, words are capitalized except for the first word.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "displayWelcomeMessage()\n",
    "getMonthlyValue()\n",
    "calculateTaxes()\n",
    "convertFeetToMeters()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments are used to pass information or data to a function depending on the task of that function.  It is up to the programmer to decide the purpose of a function and what arguments/data it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week's lesson, we will not be using arguments in our functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function should have at least a one line description of its purpose.  Function descriptions begin and end with three double quotes and are placed one line below the function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**statement(s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is any Python code required to complete the function's purpose.  You are free to have one to a million statements.  Statements **must** be indented with a tab or spaces to be part of a function.  The consensus between Python programmers is to use **4 spaces** for each level of indentation.  **Note**: you can not have tabs for some lines and spaces for others.  Your code must be all tabs or all spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions must have at least one statement.  Sometimes, a programmer will create a function with a name but then wait to fill in the statements until later.  In this case, there is a special statement called \"**pass**\" that can be used.  Otherwise, if you don't add at least one statement, Python will complain when it runs your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def displayWelcome():\n",
    "    \"\"\" Display a welcome message \"\"\"\n",
    "    # TODO - talk with client to know what to display as the welcome\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**return**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is optional.  At the end of a function's purpose/task, you might need to return a value back to the code that called this function.  When a return statement is used, the function stops running - it's finished.  For this reason, you tend to see return statements at the end of functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If a function doesn't have a return statement, the function ends when the last indented statement is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A function returning something.  The function ends after the return statement.\n",
    "def getMonthlyValue():\n",
    "    \"\"\" Prompt the user for a monthly amount \"\"\"\n",

    "# A function returning nothing.  The function ends after the print() statement.\n",
