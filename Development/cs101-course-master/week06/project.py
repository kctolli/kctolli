Instructions:

1) Create a function to display the welcome message at the start of the program.
2) Create a function that prompts the user for the current month.
3) Create a function that prompts the user for the items' name.
4) Create a function that prompts the user for the items' monthly amount.
5) Create a function to prompt the users' first name.
6) Create a function to prompt the users' surname name.
7) Call the functions above appropriately to produce output like the example below.
   NOTE: Your functions should be created above the main code that calls them and
         may need to return values to be stored in variables in your main code.

You will end up with 6 functions in this project. Name these functions
correctly (ie., use full words that describe what they do)

Remember that your program needs to handle any item name that is under 15 characters
and any monthly amount.

Example Output:
