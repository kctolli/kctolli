Description:
  This is the code for the weekly team activity.  
  Please work together in groups of 2 to 3.  
  You will not be sumbitting your code for this activity.
  You are free to continue working on this activity after class if you need more time.

"""

"""
Instructions:

Your code will be implementing a number of functions.  Each function 
displays a different shape.  Your code MUST only use the following functions
that are found in the given code below to display anything to the console. (You
may NOT use print statements in the functions you are completing.)

star()      displays a '*' character without the new line
fill()      displays a '#' character without the new line
space()     displays a ' ' character without the new line
newline()   displays a new line

Each function should be called in the main code (at the bottom of this 
file) as a result of the user choosing a menu option.  
Functions contain the sample output that you need to match.

"""
# =========================================================================
# The next four function should not be changed.  They should be used in the
# functions that you complete.
