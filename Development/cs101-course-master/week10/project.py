Here is a chart of the different starting day values and how they
map to the days of the week.

Day of the week | Starting day value
====================================
Sunday          |   1
Monday          |   2
Tuesday         |   3
Wednesday       |   4
Thursday        |   5
Friday          |   6
Saturday        |   7

Notes: 

1) when the user enters an invalid value for month or start day
   the program needs to ask the user again for a valid value.

2) Your program will need to calculate the number of days in the month
   that the user entered.  For example, if the user enters the number
   8 for August, your program needs to use 31 for the number of days
   for that month.  You can assume that the year is not a leap year
   and that February has 28 days. 

3) The function displayMonth() must use a loop to display the
   days in the month.

Sample Output (Try different values for testing your project)

Enter month (1 thru 12): 0
Enter month (1 thru 12): 55
Enter month (1 thru 12): 5
Enter start day (1 thru 7): 0
Enter start day (1 thru 7): 99
Enter start day (1 thru 7): 3
