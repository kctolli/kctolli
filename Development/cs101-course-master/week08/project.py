Instructions:
    Here's your chance to be creative.  Write a program that will allow the user
    to play a "Choose Your Own Adventure" type game.  Here are the requirements
    of complexity:
    1) Each decision must have only 2 choices to choose from.
       Use "1" and "2" as your options (to make grading simpler.)
    2) The game must have the user make at least 3 choices before the game ends.
    3) Your game must have only two possible endings
       (ie. Live/Die, Win/Lose, Escaped/Captured).
    4) The code for the ending situations must be more than just a single print
       statement that says "You WIN!" but should be more exciting!
       (ie. This is better:
       
                *******************************************
                *                                         *
                *      You are the best in the land!      *
                *                                         *
                *******************************************
        )
    5) For full credit (you can get 90% without it), call functions as a result
       of making a choice.
       (ie.
       if choice1 == "1":
           openRedDoor() 
       elif choice1 == "2":
           runOtherWay()
    6) For extra credit (5-10%), learn to use a library to do something special,
       like display a graphic or tell the user how much time they took to finish.
