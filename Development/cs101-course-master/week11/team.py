Description:
  This is the code for the weekly team activity.  
  Please work together in groups of 2 to 3.  
  You will not be sumbitting your code for this activity.
  You are free to continue working on this activity after class if you need more time.

Instructions:

- Write a program to match the sample output.  Attention to detail is important.
- You will be using a list for this program.
- Your program will ask the user for the number of temperatures
  This value should be >= 2
- convert the temperatures to Celsius using: (5.0 / 9.0 * (temp - 32.0))
- You are free to create functions if you want.

Sample Output:

Enter number of temperatures: 4
Enter temperature 1: 20
Enter temperature 2: 5
Enter temperature 3: 99
Enter temperature 4: 34
20 is -6.7 Celsius
5 is -15.0 Celsius
99 is 37.2 Celsius
34 is 1.1 Celsius
Max temperature = 99
Min temperature = 5
difference between the first two values: 15
difference between the last two values: 65
Average temperature = 39.5
Sorted list of temperatures = [5, 20, 34, 99]
List of temperatures with min and max removed = [20, 34]
