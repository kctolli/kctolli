        <p class="subtitle">Java Interfaces</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Understand the design principle "Program to an interface, not an implementation".</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn when it is appropriate to use an interface.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn how to implement an interface in Java.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Software Design Principle</h3>
        <h4>Program to an interface, not an implementation.</h4>
        <p>Using interfaces makes our code more flexible. To understand why this is:</p>

        <ol class='checklist'>
            <li><p>First, read <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html">this official description of interfaces from Oracle's Java Documentation</a> in order to get a basic idea of what an interface is.</p></li>
            <li><p>Next, watch this video, which shows how interfaces can help us avoid a particular design issue:</p>
            <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Aef6vnAxR8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p></li>
            <li><p>Then, read the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383947/what-does-it-mean-to-program-to-an-interface">first answer to this Stack Overflow question</a> to understand the main advantage of interfaces.</p>
            <li><p>Finally, read the top four answers to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/504904/is-there-more-to-an-interface-than-having-the-correct-methods">this Stack Overflow post</a> to see other advantages and thoughts about interfaces.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>After reading that material, you should understand the advantages provided by programming to an interface rather than an implementation.</p>

        <p>Namely, it allows our code to move away from this design: <em>"I need this specific class in order to do this work."</em> and instead use this more flexible idea: <em>"I can use any class that can do this kind of thing in order to do this work."</em></p>

        <h3>Java Coding</h3>
        <p>Now that you know what interfaces are and why they are useful, read through <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_interfaces.htm">this tutorial</a> for more details on how to use interfaces in Java.</p>

        <h3>Reading Quiz</h3>
        <p>Don't forget to take the Reading Quiz in I-Learn. This quiz can be taken as many times as you like, but you must score at least 90% to pass. If you fail the quiz, review the relevant parts of the reading and try again.</p>
        <p>As before, one of the quiz questions is a "deep thought" question whose answer won't come directly from the reading.</p>
