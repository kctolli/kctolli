        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>Before continuing, you should have completed this week's <a href="./prepare.html">preparation assignment</a>.</p>

        <p>You're going to practice implementing interfaces in Java by creating a vacation cost calculator. There are lots of different components that contribute to the cost of a vacation, transportation, food, lodging etc...</p>

        <p>In order to keep our class hierarchy flexible, we're going to create a common interface that will allow us to get the cost of these components.</p> 

        <h4>Part I: Create the Expense Interface and Cruise Class</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, define an interface called <code>Expense</code> that requires a single method:</p>
<pre><code class="java">float getCost();
</code></pre>
                <p>Typically, interfaces in Java go in their own file, so this one would go in a file called <em>Expense.java.</em></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, create an enum type called <code>Destination</code>, which contains three possible options for its values:</p>
<pre><code class="java">enum Destination {
    Mexico, Europe, Japan
}
</code></pre>
                <p>Like the interface, enums are defined in their own, separate files. This one should go in a file called <em>Destination.java</em>.</p>

                <p>It might seem overcomplicated to put the enum and interface in their own files, since they both contain such a small amount of code, but putting everything in its own file is the "Java Way".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, create a class called <code>Cruise</code> whose constructor takes a <code>Destination</code>.</p>
                <p>Add all of the code necessary to make <code>Cruise</code> implement the <code>Expense</code> interface.</p>
                <p>The <code>Cruise</code> class should calculate its costs this way:</p>
                <table><tr><th>Destination</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
                       <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>$1000.00</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Europe</td><td>$2000.00</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Japan</td><td>$3000.00</td></tr>
                </table>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Part II: Create Your Driver Class</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a Java class called <code>VacationCalculator</code>. This class will contain your <code>main()</code> method, which will create an instance of the class and invoke methods on that instance:</p>
<pre><code class="java">class VacationCalculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        VacationCalculator vc = new VacationCalculator();
        
        // Calculate some vacation costs...
        float japanCost = vc.calculateVacationCost(Destination.Japan);

        // Print the cost...
    }

    /**
     * Calculates the total cost for vacationing at a given location for 
     * a specific number of nights.
     *
     * @param  dest the destination of the vacation
     * @return      the total cost of the vacation
    */
    public float calculateVacationCost(Destination dest)
    {

    }

    /**
     * An internal method used by VacationCalculator to loop through
     * a List of items that implement the Expense interface and 
     * determine their cost 
     *
     * @param  expenses A list of items that implement the Expense interface
     * @return          the total cost calculated by the items
    */
    float tallyExpenses(List&lt;Expense&gt; expenses)
    {

    }
}
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Write the code for the <code>tallyExpenses</code> function. It should loop through the list of items in the <code>expenses</code> parameter and return the sum of their costs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Write the code for the <code>calculateVacationCost</code> function. It should create an <code>ArrayList</code> of Expenses, add a <code>Cruise</code> instance for that list for the proper destination, then use the <code>tallyExpenses</code> method to determine the cost of that vacation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Finally, in <code>main</code>, create an instance of the <code>VacationCalculator</code> class, and call the <code>calculateVacationCost</code> function in order to determine the cost of going on a vacation to Japan. Print the result to console using a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/formatting.html">format specifier</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you've made it this far, move on the stretch challenge.</p>

        <h4 class="stretch">ðŸŒŸStretch ChallengeðŸŒŸ</h4>
        <p>Going on a cruise is great, but we might also want to stay at our destination for a certain length of time. So, we'll need to calcuate those expenses as well and include them in our vacation cost.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a class called <code>Dining</code> that also implements the <code>Expense</code> interface.</p>
                <p>The constructor for the <code>Dining</code> class should include two parameters, one for the destination, and one for the number of nights you'll be staying there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <code>Dining</code> class should calculate its cost this way:</p>
                <table><tr><th>Destination</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
                       <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>$10.00 per day</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Europe</td><td>$20.00 per day</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Japan</td><td>$30.00 per day</td></tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Add another class called <code>Lodging</code> that also implements the <code>Expense</code> interface. Its constructor should also take the destination and number of nights as parameters.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <code>Lodging</code> class should calculate its cost this way:</p>
                <table><tr><th>Destination</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
                       <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>$100.00 per day</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Europe</td><td>$200.00 per day + 10% Hotel Tax Surchage</td></tr>
                       <tr><td>Japan</td><td>$300.00 per day + 30% Hotel Tax Surchage</td></tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In your driver class, modify the <code>calculateVacationCost</code> so that you can specify how many days you'll be spending at your destination and have the function include a lodging and dining as part of the itenerary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Update your <code>main</code> function to calculate the cost of traveling to each destination and staying there for 5 days.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations! You now know how to use Java interfaces.</p>
        <p>Make sure everyone on your team understands and receives a copy of this code.</p>
