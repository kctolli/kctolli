        <h2>02 Team : Team Formation</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Form a project team.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Formation</h3>
        <p>This week, you need to self-identify teams of 3 these week. This forum is designed to aid in that process.</p>

        <p>Once you've identified a team you'd like to be on, you need to contact the person who propsed the project and see if you can join that team.</p>

        <p>I will sometimes allow teams of 2, or teams of 4 or 5, but you need to make a strong case for why such a team would benefit your project.</p>

        <p>Once you've identified the team you'd like to be on, post your request to the associated I-Learn quiz. If you are unable to find a team, I will put you together with other people who also can't find a team. Historically, these teams do not do very well, so avoid that at all costs.</p>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <ol class='checklist'>
            <li>
                <p>Read through the project ideas in Slack and find one that looks interesting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Contact the person associated with the project to see if you can join their team.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you find a team.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Submit your team member's names to the associated quiz on I-Learn.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
