        <h2>13 Team : Project Report Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Prepare a final project report with the following sections.</p>
        <p>When complete, upload this document to I-Learn as a .pdf, .doc, or .docx format. A <a href="./sample-final-report.doc">sample document</a> is provided that you are welcome to use as a template.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p><header>Project Summary</header></p>
                <p>Give a brief overview (about 3-4 paragraphs) of the project, how it came together, and the process of development, including highlights of lessons learned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><header>Primary Individual Contributions</header></p>
                <p>Please describe your primary contributions to the code of the project. It is understood that this was a team project with each person helping the others, but try to highlight areas in which you had significant ownership or responsibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><header>Time Breakdown</header></p>
                <p>Looking back through your weekly status reports, list the approximate number of hours you worked on the project each week, along with the total. If you don't have exact hours for one of the weeks, make your best estimate.</p>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><header>Self-evaluation of the project</header></p>
                <p>Evaluate the project according to the provided <a href="./project-rubric.pdf">final project rubric</a>. Provide a sub-section for each category and list specific examples of why the project meets that category. This need not be overly verbose, but you should have 1-2 sentences for each of the following:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Working code</p></li>
                    <li><p>Requirements</p></li>
                    <li><p>Design Principles</p></li>
                    <li><p>Code style</p></li>
                    <li><p>Documentation</p></li>
                    <li><p>Version Control</p></li>
                </ol>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><header>Grade calculation</header></p>
                <p>Include a table that shows your performance level for each criterion. Then, using the weights in the project rubric calculate an overall score for the project and include any pertinent comments about that score.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><header>Team member contribution</header></p>
                <p>This will be kept confidential.</p>
                <p>For yourself and each member of the team, award up to 10 points according to the following:</p>

                <p>Then, briefly describe your interaction with your teammates, and include any pertinent comments about their contributions to the project (e.g., if one person did significantly more or less than expected, etc.).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
