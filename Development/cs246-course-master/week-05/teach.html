        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Create your first Android project.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>Before continuing, you should have completed this week's <a href="./prepare.html">preparation assignment</a>.</p>

        <p>You're going to create a basic Android application. Previously, we've had one person on the team do the coding. This week, each person should create their own app, and the team should work together to make sure everyone complete the project successfully.</p>

        <p>You'll have three options for testing your apps. You can put your deveice into <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/">Developer mode</a> and use that (Easiest and Fastest)</p>
        <p>Or, you can use the Android Studio emulator to run a fake Android device within a window on your computer.</p>
        <p>Or, you can use a third-party emulator.</p>

        <p>If you have trouble getting the default emulator to run, you might need to change some configuration options on your machine. The answers on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21635504/error-during-installing-haxm-vt-x-not-working" target="_blank">this Stack Overflow post</a> explain the most common issues.</p>
        <p>If all else fails, you can use install and configure a 3rd party Android emulator, such as <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/download" target="_blank">Genymotion. (You'll need to create an account on their site to download the free version for individuals)</a>
        </p>
