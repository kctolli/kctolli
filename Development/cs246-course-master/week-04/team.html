        <h2>04 Team : Statement of Work</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Develop a formal proposal for your team project.</p></li>
            <li><p>Identify required and stretch goals.</p></li>
            <li><p>Make sure your project sponsor is in agreement.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Statement of Work</h3>
        <p>As a team, you need to develop a brief proposal for your team project. This will define the scope of the project, and help you to distinguish between required features and "nice to have" features.</p>
        <p>Also, please note that this is a contract between your team and your sponsor. You will be held accountable for delivering each of the required features, so be mindful of what you promise.</p>
        <p>It is much better to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around. This doesn't mean just put "Hello World", but it does mean that you need to be thoughtful about the core features that your sponsor needs in order for the solution to be workable.</p>
        <p>In addition to core requirements, you will also list stretch goals. Stretch goals are features that you hope to be able to include. They will make your project better, but aren't required in order to achieve the base functionality.</p>
        <p>Please note that to earn a 90% (Good) on the "requirements" line item of the final project rubric, you must complete the required features. In order to get 100% (Exceptional, not just good) for that line item, you will be expected to complete some stretch goals as well.</p>

        <ol class='checklist'>
            <li><p>Read the Description section of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product#Description">Minimum viable product</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Next, download <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/293bd79c-74bc-4a59-95e4-3b064557ad86/1/attachments/246-04-statement_of_work.pdf">this template</a> and read over it as a team.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meet with your sponsor to understand their project requirements.</p></li>
            <li><p>Identify the list of required features and stretch goals.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have <strong>each member</strong> of your team and your project sponsor sign the Statement of Work (by typing their name in the correct box).</p></li>

            <div class="tips">
                <p>Instructor Tip</p>
                <p>The Statement of Work also contains a signature line for the instructor. The way you get the instructor's approval/signature is to submit the PDF (signed by the team and the sponsor) to I-Learn, where the instructor will review it, and agree to it. You do not need to obtain the instructor's signature prior to submission.</p>
            </div>


            <li><p>Submit the completed PDF to I-Learn.</p>
            <p><strong>When you submit the PDF, make sure the one you are submitting is not blank.</strong> You'll need to Save or Export as PDF (Depending on your operating system). Then open the saved file and confirm it contains the data you enetered.</p></li>
