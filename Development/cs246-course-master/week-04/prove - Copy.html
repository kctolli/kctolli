        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Learn how branching works with git.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn how to fix problems you might encounter with git.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Branching</h3>
        <p>One of the most powerful features of git is the concept of branches. When you create a branch in git, it's like creating a separate workspace in the project just for you. You can make changes in your branch, experiment with new ideas, and even commit your work, without disrupting the code in the rest of the project.</p>
        <p>Once you're ready for your changes to become part of the project, you can <em>merge</em> your branch. If you decide your changes were a bad idea, you can simply delete the branch.</p>

        <h4>Part I (46.5%) - Git Interactive Tutorial:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>

                <p><strong>Submission Note</strong>: In the past, this was listed as a 25 part "TryGit interactive tutorial." When you take the I-Learn assessment, if the first question says, "I completed all 25 parts of the TryGit interactive tutorial" you may consider that to be saying instead, "I completed scenarios 1-9 of the Katacoda interactive tutorial" and answer accordingly.</p>
