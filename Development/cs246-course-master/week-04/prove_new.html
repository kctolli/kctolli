        <p class="subtitle">Version Control with GitHub</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Write Java code and configure it using git and GitHub</p></li>
            <li>
          <p>Practice using branches in Git</p></li>
        </ul>

  <h3>Team Development</h3>
    <p>It this exercise, you will create a simple Java program and put it into GitHub. You will then ask one of your team members to make a change to your project. You will also make a change to another team member's project.    </p>
  <ol>
      <p>Step 1: Create a project in IntelliJ called HelloFrom&lt;Name&gt; (if you first name was Bob, then this would be HelloFromBob).      </p>
      <p>Step 2: Before writing any code, import your project into Github by going to menu option VCS, selecting &quot;Import into Version Control&quot;, and selecting &quot;Share Project on Github&quot;.</p>
            <p>Step 3: You will likely be prompted to login to Github.  After providing your credentials, you will prompted to create a GitHub repository. Make sure that the repository is public (don't select the private checkbox). You will likely be prompted to commit basic IntelliJ project files (e.g. modules.xml). Select Add to commit those files and push to your repository in GitHub.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Goto GitHub and verify that you see your new repository.</p>
            <p>Step 5: Write code in your IntelliJ project to say &quot;Hello, my name is &lt;your name&gt;&quot;. Run your program to make sure it works. </p>
            <p>Step 6: Using either the Git tools in IntelliJ or using the Git Bash command line, commit and push your changes. Goto GitHub and very that you see your changes.</p>
            <p>Step 7: While in Github, click on Settings and goto to Collaborators. Add all members of your team as collaborators for your project.</p>
        <p>Step 8: At least one member of your team must make a modification in your project. You must make at least one modification in another team members project. To make a modification in another project, goto IntelliJ and select (from either the VCS menu or when you first start IntelliJ and no other project is open) Checkout from Version Control (select git). You will need to type in the URL for your teammate's repository in GitHub. You will also specify where you want the project to be placed on your hard drive.</p>
        <p>Step 9: Add a line of code in the program to display &quot;Hello &lt;your team members name&gt;, my name is &lt;your name&gt;.&quot; Run the program to make sure it works.</p>
        <p>Step 10: Using either the Git tools in IntelliJ or using the Git Bash command line, commit and push your changes.  If a merge conflict happens, you will need to manually fix the merge conflict. </p>
      <p>Step 11: After someone has successfully updated your project and you have successfully updated someone else's project, then you are done and can take the quiz in I-Learn.</p>

    <ol>
 
          <p>One of the powerful features of git is the concept of branches. When you create a branch in git, it's like creating a separate workspace in the project just for you. You can make changes in your branch, experiment with new ideas, and even commit your work, without disrupting the code in the rest of the project.          
          <p>Once you're ready for your changes to become part of the project, you can <em>merge</em> your branch. If you decide your changes were a bad idea, you can simply delete the branch.</p>
