        <p class="subtitle">Observer Pattern</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Learn about the Observer pattern.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The Observer pattern is a very, very common Behavioral pattern. At an abstract level, you can think of your click handlers in Android and other event-driven code as using the Observer pattern.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the observer pattern is to allow a class to be notified when certain properties in another class change, or when certain event occur.</p>

        <p>Unlike other design patterns, Java actually has some built-in classes to help with the Observer pattern, but you don't have to use those classes to use the Observer pattern.</p>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Read <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer">this overview</a> of the Observer pattern.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Take a look at the example of how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern#Example">Java's built-in Observer and Observable code</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13744450/when-should-we-use-observer-and-observable">this StackOverflow post</a>, which gives more details about Observer and Observable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30362166/why-is-observable-a-class-and-observer-an-interface">this StackOverflow post, which explains why Observable is a class but Observer is an interface</a>, and what you should do about it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Optionally, you might be interested to know how the Observer pattern is often used in iOS and Mac programming, through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html">Key-Value Observing system</a> and <a href="http://nshipster.com/nsnotification-and-nsnotificationcenter/">NSNotificationCenter</a>.</p>
                <p>Also optionally, you might be interested to see <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1474/Events-and-event-handling-in-C">how the Observer pattern is often used in Windows programming</a>.</p>
