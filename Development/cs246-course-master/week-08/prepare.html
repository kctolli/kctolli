        <h3>Objectives</h3>

         <ul>
            <li><p>Understand how Test-Driven Development works.</p></li>
            <li><p>Understand how to write unit tests for Android projects.</p></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Before meeting with your team for your team activity, please read the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Become familiar with unit testing terminology and JUnit by reading sections 1 - 4 of <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html">this article</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Read <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/introduction-to-java-tdd">this introduction to Test Driven Development</a></p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Then look through the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/start/index.html">official Android developer pages</a> on unit testing. Note that you'll be creating what the documentation calls <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html">Local Unit Tests</a>. You don't need to worry about mock objects for this assignment, but it might be good for your future to <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Mockito/article.html#testing-with-mock-objects">know what their purpose is</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reading Quiz</h3>
        <p>Don't forget to take the Reading Quiz in I-Learn. This quiz can be taken as many times as you like, but you must score at least 90% to pass. If you fail the quiz, review the relevant parts of the reading and try again.</p>
        <p>As before, one of the quiz questions is a "deep thought" question whose answer won't come directly from the reading.</p>
