        <h2>Feature Change Request</h2>
        <p>A change to the core promised features of the application should be very rare. We should think carefully about the features and requirements we commit to before starting the project.</p>

        <p>However, there may be times when an unforeseen circumstance simply makes it impossible to complete a feature as planned. For example, a core API that you were planning to use does not exist or work the way you needed, and there is not a reasonable workaround, or the data that a feature was built around is not available as planned. Please note that “we ran out of time” is not a valid reason.</p>
        <p>In these cases, you need to download the Feature Change Request form, and email a copy to both your sponsor and the instructor for approval.</p>
