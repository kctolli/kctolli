            <li><p>Understand how to connect to Slack.</p></li>

        <p>Slack is a team communication service that we'll be using for this class. It's like a chat room, but with a lot of extra features such as file-sharing, threaded-discussions, and search capabilities that make it ideal for software teams. Like other tools we'll use in this class, Slack is widely used in the software industry.</p>

        <p>Depending on how your instructor sets up Slack for your course, you'll either receive a Slack invitation via email, or you will be provided with a signup URL by the instructor. Either way, click the provided link and follow the directions to get signed up. Afterwards, you can <a href="https://slack.com/downloads/">download a Slack client</a> for your computer or mobile device if you wish, or continue to use the web interface.</p>

        <h3>Slack Channels</h3>
        <p>Communication in Slack is divided into channels. Most of our class-wide communication will happen in the #general channel.</p>

        <p>Once project teams have been established, private team channels will be created for each team to use.</p>

        <p>In addition, you can send direct messages to your instructor (or to other students).</p>

        <p>There are no discussion boards in this course, but a portion of your Team Assignments grade will come from your participation on Slack. In addition, if you have a pressing question about something, you can often get a response faster by sending a direct message to the instructor on Slack than by emailing.</p>

        <h3>Slack Etiquette</h3>
        <p>It's important to be professional in your online communications. Aside from the standard guidelines of not using ALL-CAPS TO COMMUNICATE and speaking respectfully, you should be aware of <a href="http://blog.invoca.com/7-rules-every-professional-needs-to-know-about-slack-etiquette/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=linkedin">Slack-specific etiquette</a>.</p>
