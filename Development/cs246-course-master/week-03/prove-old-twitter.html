        <p class="subtitle">JSON APIs</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Understand what an API is and how they're used.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn to parse a JSON response from an API.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn to store and access data in a Map.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>APIs</h3>

        <p>Companies with data-driven websites will often create APIs, (Application Programming Interfaces) to allow people to programmatically pull data from their site.</p>

        <p><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate/">Google Translate</a>, and <a href="https://go.developer.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>, are just a few examples of sites that provide public APIs.</p>

        <p>Developers use APIs for a variety of reasons. Often, they want to pull specific types of data for data-mining. Other times, they might want to create their own applications that use the services of those companies, such as an iOS app that allows you to sell things on Ebay.</p>

        <p>While every API is different, the general sequence of steps is usually the same:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Sign up for a developer account (sometimes called an API Key) with the organization whose API you want to access and obtain authentication credentials.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <p>Send an HTTP request to authenticate with the API using the authentication credentials you were given and receive an authentication token.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <p>Use that authentication token to make API requests via HTTP to specific URLs (called "end points") which allow you to retrieve the data that you're interested in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The data is returned in a structured format. The most common data format for APIs is JSON.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tips">
            <p>Instructor Note:</p>
            <p>As mentioned, nearly all APIs will require you to sign up for a developer account of some sort. This assignment has you sign up for a Twitter developer account (which requires a regular Twitter account), which is free. If you do not have or wish not to create a personal Twitter account, you might consider creating one that does not relate to your identity in any way (e.g., aSimpleTwitterUser12312), which could be deleted after this assignment.</p>
            <p>If creating any Twitter account will not work for your situation, for whatever reason, you are welcome to work with the instructor to propose an alternative assignment. For an alternative, you should look for a different API that you can query and receive data, ideally finding one that has a Java wrapper (e.g., similar to how twitter4j is a wrapper around the Twitter API). Then, you can follow a similar process to retrieve data from the API, put it into collections and sort it in meaningful ways, just as this assignment outlines with Tweets.</p>
            <p>If you have any issues in this regard or decide to pursue an alternative assignment, please be in contact with your instructor about it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>You will write a program that uses the Twitter API to retrieve tweets made with the hash tag #byui. You'll first display the tweets in order by the user's name, then in order by the number of followers the user has.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning</strong></p>
        <p>This assignment is more difficult than any of your past assignments. I have purposefully left out many of the implementation details, which will force you to do quite a bit of research on your own.</p>
        <p>Make sure you exercise diligence prior to asking for help.</p>

        <h4>Part I: Obtain a Twitter API Account</h4>
        <p>As is the case for most popular APIs, Twitter requires developers to first sign up for a developer account and acquire a set of API credentials before using their API.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/">https://apps.twitter.com/</a> and sign in using your Twitter account. If you don't have a Twitter account, create one, then sign in to the app developer site above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click on the link to create or register a new app, and fill out the form that appears. The exact values you use for name, description, and website do not matter very much for our purposes, but you must adhere to the rules Twitter has in place for uniqueness and length.</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="screenshot-xlarge" src="./img/create-app.png"/>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once the application has been created, click on the tab labeled "Keys and Access Tokens"</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="screenshot-medium" src="./img/api-keys.png"/>
                </p>
                <p>Here you will find your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. You'll need these values for Part III.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Below the application information, click on the button labeled "Create Access Token".</p>
                <p>This will cause an access token to be generated for your application using your Twitter account permissions. Make note of the Access Token and Access Token Secret. You'll also need these values for Part III.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

         <p><strong>Security Warning</strong></p>
         
         <p>Note that some of these items are labeled <em>Secret</em> for a reason. You should not share these values with anyone. You should remove them from your code before submitting it.</p>
         <p>With these token values, anyone can access your Twitter account and post messages as if they were you.</p>
         <p>This same caution is generally true for all APIs that use authentication tokens.</p>


        <h4>Part II: Load the Necessary Libraries</h4>
        <p>We'll be using a 3rd party API to assist us in handing the API calls. While we could make these requests using the built-in libraries of the Java framework, such as <code>HttpClient</code>, this will make our program much more complex, especially when attempting to handle the authentication step.</p>
        <p>Instead, we'll use a 3rd party library called <em>twitter4j</em>, which will make this process much less complicated.</p>
        <p>We'll also make use of the GSON library again to handle parsing the JSON data ourselves.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new IntelliJ project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a reference to the GSON library as you did for <a href="./teach.html">the teach assignment</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use that same process to add a reference to the twitter4j library. (We're specifically going to be using the library called <em>org.twitter4j:twitter4j-core:4.0.6</em>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Part III: Create a Class to Store the Data</h4>
        <p>There is a lot of information in a tweet, but for this assignment we only care about some of it.</p>
        <p>As we did in <a href="./teach.html">the teach assignment</a>, we'll be creating a class to hold just the data we're interested in.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, create two classes based on the following UML diagram:</p>
                <p><img class="screenshot-large" src="./img/BYUI-tweet.png"/></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Now, when the GSON library deserializes a JSON String into a class instance, it expects the key names in the JSON to exactly match the variable names of the class.</p>
                <p>Sometimes this isn't ideal, so it provides a way for you to specify which JSON key should connect to a given variable in a class.</p>
                <p>In our case, we have a variable in our <code>User</code> class called <code>followers</code>, but in the JSON string we get back from Twitter, the number of followers is stored in a key called "follower_count". So, we need to add an "annotation" to our variable to tell GSON that those two things should go together.</p>
                <p>Modify the declaration of <code>followers</code> in your <code>User</code> class so it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">@SerializedName("followers_count")
int followers;
</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Part IV: Retrieve the Data</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a class called <code>TweetLoader</code>. This class will serve as our "Data Access Layer", giving us a single point of access to the Twitter API.</p>
                <p>The class should contain a private member variable of type <code>Twitter</code> (from the twitter4j library).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have the constructor call a private member function called <code>configureKeys()</code> which will use the code similar to the following to configure the twitter4j library (make sure to replace the authentication strings with your developer keys you received from Twitter):</p>
<pre><code class="java">ConfigurationBuilder cb = new ConfigurationBuilder();

// This continuous set of function calls all connected together is referred to
// as "method chaining". It is a popular technique amongst web developers and has
// gradually found its way into other languages.
//
// The way it works is that each setter returns a reference to the object.
// For example, the code in the setDebugEnabled function might look like this:
//
//  ConfigurationBuilder setDebugEnabled(Boolean value) {
//      this.debugEnabled = value;
// 
//      // Returning "this" allows method chaining.
//      return this;  
//  }
//
cb.setDebugEnabled(true)
    .setOAuthConsumerKey("PUT YOUR CONSUMER KEY HERE")
    .setOAuthConsumerSecret("PUT YOUR CONSUMER SECRET HERE")
    .setOAuthAccessToken("PUT YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE")
    .setOAuthAccessTokenSecret("PUT YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET HERE")
    .setJSONStoreEnabled(true);

TwitterFactory tf = new TwitterFactory(cb.build());
this.twitter = tf.getInstance();
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a public function to the class called <code>retrieveTweetsWithHashTag(String hashtag)</code>. It should return a <code>Map</code> with instances of <code>String</code> for keys and instances of <code>BYUITweet</code> as values.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In this function, you'll need to do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create an instance of a class that implements the Map interface. Popular options are <code>HashMap</code> and <code>TreeMap</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use the <code>search()</code> method of the <code>Twitter</code> object to retrieve all tweets with the hashtag supplied in the hashtag parameter.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Loop through every <code>Status</code> message stored in the results, and use the <code>TwitterObjectFactory.getRawJSON()</code> function to get the JSON String for that tweet.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use the GSON library to deserialize that JSON string into an instance of the <code>BYUITweet</code> class.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Store that instance in the <code>Map</code> you created, using the user name of the tweet as the key.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Finally, when the loop ends, return the <code>Map</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In <code>main()</code>, create an instance of the <code>TweetLoader</code> class and call its <code>retrieveTweetsWithHashTag()</code> function to retrieve tweets with the <em>#byui</em> hashtag.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Loop through the results, and display the user name, the user's follower count, and the text of the tweet in this format, making sure that they are displayed in alphabetical order by the user's name:</p>
<pre><code class="markdown">CoolMormonGuy (48 Followers) - This is the best school ever! #byui
</code></pre>
            </li>

        </ol>

            <p>Once you've made it this far, move on the stretch challenge.</p>
            
            <h4 class="stretch">🌟Stretch Challenge🌟</h4>
            
            <p>Now, display the tweets in order by the user's follower count, so that the users with the most followers appear first.</p>
            
            <p>There are several ways to accomplish this. The most elegant methods make use of <code>Collections.sort()</code> and either a custom <code>Comparator</code> class, or a <em>lambda function.</em></p>
