        <h3>Java Types</h3>
        <p>Let's take a moment to discuss Java's basic data types. Like most languages, Java has <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code>, etc.... These are called <em>primitive</em> types. They are memory efficient and take up relatively little space.</p>

        <p>In addition to primitive types, Java also has wrapper classes for each of the primitives. For example, there is a class called <code>Integer</code> that serves as a wrapper class for the <code>int</code> primitive. Aside from providing some <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html">useful functionality</a>, these wrapper classes allow us to use primitive data types in situations that require objects, such as when dealing with collections:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Integer myInt = 3;
List&lt;Integer&gt; myNumbers;
myNumbers.add(myInt);
</code></pre>
        <p>Java will automatically convert back and forth between primitives and wrapper classes as needed through a process called <em>autoboxing</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Integer myInt = 3;
System.out.println(myInt + 2);
</code></pre>
        <p>People try to avoid the use of wrapper classes and autoboxing whenever possible, because there are pretty strong performance hits in their use.</p>

        <h3>Collections</h3>

        <p>Collections are containers that allow us to efficiently store and process data. In C++, you likely worked with vectors, and possibly trees, maps, and linked-lists. These are all types of collections.</p>

        <p>In Java, all collections implement the <code>Collection</code> interface. This interface defines a list of methods that all collections must implement. Some of these include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><code>add()</code> A way to add elements to a collection.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>clear()</code> A way to remove all elements from a collection.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>contains()</code> A way to see if a collection contains an element.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>size()</code> A way to see how many elements a collection contains.</p></li>
            <li><p>etc...</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Take some time to look over the complete list of methods every collection must provide, by looking at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#method.summary">the official documentation for the Collection interface</a>.</p>

        <h4>Collection Interfaces and Generics</h4>
        <p>Java provides several <em>subinterfaces</em> that extend the collection interface. Some commonly used ones are <code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>Set</code>. Each of these interfaces define additional methods that are appropriate for those types of collections.</p>

        <p>Java's collections are all "generic" types. They work in a similar way to how templates work in C++. Last week, we saw a <code>List</code> of <code>Creature</code> objects could be declared like this:</p>
<pre><code class="java">List&lt;Creature&gt; someCreatures;
</code></pre>

        <p>As with C++, the type of thing that will be stored in the collection goes inside the angle brackets. Once a collection has been initialized, only objects of that type (or objects that inherit from that type) may be stored in the collection.</p>

        <p>Note that it's not just class names we can use as the generic type. We can also use interfaces:</p>
<pre><code class="java">List&lt;Movable&gt; someThingsThatMove;
</code></pre>

        <h4>Concrete Implementations</h4>
        <p>Java also provides several concrete classes that implement the various collection interfaces. (A <em>concrete class</em> is a class you can instantiate using the <code>new</code> keyword, as opposed to an abstract class or interface).</p>

        <p>You can see a list of all the classes that implement a particular interface by looking at the <em>All Known Implementing Classes:</em> section of the interface documentation. For example, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">the documentation for the List interface</a> shows several classes that implement that interface. The most commonly used are <code>ArrayList</code> and <code>LinkedList</code>.</p>

        <p>Typically, when we use a collection, we instantiate it using the concrete class whose attributes we need, but we store it as an interface:</p>

<pre><code class="java">List&lt;Creature&gt; creatures = new ArrayList&lt;Creature&gt;();
</code></pre>

        <p>By storing it as an interface, the rest of our code is isolated from having to change if we decide on a different implementation, as long as we have something that implements <code>List</code>, nothing else has to change.</p>

        <h4>Collections Example</h4>
        <p>Consider this example:</p>

        <p>You've been working on an asteroids game, and you need to store a collection of <code>Rock</code> classes. You decide to use <code>ArrayList</code> because it's the most familiar to you. You write your <code>AsteroidManager</code> class that keeps track of all of the asteroids like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class AsteroidManager {

  ArrayList&lt;Asteroid&gt; _asteroids;

  public AsteroidManager() {
    _asteroids = new ArrayList&lt;Asteroid&gt;();
  }

  public ArrayList&lt;Asteroid&gt; getAsteroids() {
    return _asteroids;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Let's imagine that this is a complex program with lots of other classes interacting with the <code>AsteroidManager</code> class. Each of those classes calls the <code>getAsteroids()</code> function at different times and performs operations on the <code>ArrayList</code>.</p>

        <p>One day, you realize that <code>ArrayList</code> is actually the wrong choice for this situation, because you frequently need to add and remove asteroids at the end of the list, a task that the <code>LinkedList</code> class is better suited for. So you decide to change your <code>AsteroidManager</code> class to use a <code>LinkedList</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class AsteroidManager {

  LinkedList&lt;Asteroid&gt; _asteroids;

  public AsteroidManager() {
    _asteroids = new LinkedList&lt;Asteroid&gt;();
  }

  public LinkedList&lt;Asteroid&gt; getAsteroids() {
    return _asteroids;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Unfortunately, not only did you have to change the <code>AsteroidManager</code> code in several places, but you'll also have to modify every single class that calls <code>getAsteroids()</code>, because the return type has changed.</p>

        <p>This problem could have been prevented if we had initially used the <code>List</code> interface to store our <code>ArrayList</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class AsteroidManager {

  List&lt;Asteroid&gt; _asteroids;

  public AsteroidManager() {
    _asteroids = new ArrayList&lt;Asteroid&gt;();
  }

  public List&lt;Asteroid&gt; getAsteroids() {
    return _asteroids;
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Now, to switch to a <code>LinkedList</code>, we only need to change one line of code:</p>

<pre><code class="java">_asteroids = new LinkedList&lt;Asteroid&gt;();     
</code></pre>
        
        <p>All the rest of our code just cares that we're using something that implements the <code>List</code> interface, no matter what that something is. These types of situations are one of the main reasons why we "program to an interface, not an implementation".</p>

        <h3>Primitive Arrays</h3>
        <p>One downside to the collection classes like <code>ArrayList</code> is that they can only store objects. While wrapper classes or autoboxing will allow us to store primitive values using these classes, there is enough of a performance penalty that we usually want to avoid it.</p>

        <p>So, instead of using something like <code>ArrayList</code> to store a list of <code>int</code> values, we can use a simple array, just like in C++:</p>

<pre><code class="java">int[] a = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(a[0]);
</code></pre>

        <p>A couple of things to note about Java arrays:</p>

        <p>First, once an array has been created, its size cannot be changed. (You can modify its values, but you can't add or remove values.)</p>
        <p>Second, Java arrays can store anything, including objects (though we usually use a Java collection class for those situations):</p>
<pre><code class="java">// Create an array that can hold six Student objects
Student[] students = new Student[6];
students[0].printName();
</code></pre>
        <p>Finally, Java arrays always know their length:</p>
<pre><code class="java">// Create an array that can hold four floats
float grades[] = new float[4];
// Prints 4
System.out.println(grades.length);
</code></pre>
