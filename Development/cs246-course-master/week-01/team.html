        <h2>01 Team : First Thoughts Pitch</h2>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Begin brainstorming ideas for a team project.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Projects</h3>
        <p>The majority of this semester will be spent working in teams developing a real project for a real sponsor. Part of your responsibility is to find a sponsor and a project to work on. It will be turned in as your final during the last week of class. You will be expected to show consistent progress through a series of deliverable milestones.</p>
        <p>This week, you need to start talking to people around you (neighbors, bosses, co-workers, family members, etc.) to see what ideas you can find, and then give a “pitch” for one of these ideas in the #first-thoughts-pitch channel on Slack.</p>
        <div class="tips">
        <p>Instructor Tips</p>
        <p>To find this channel, you'll have to click on "Channels" and then select it from the list. Also, to help keep the channel somewhat organized, it might be helpful to post new ideas as new comments, but when replying to someone else's idea, you can reply to it as a 'thread'. That will keep them all grouped together.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is not a commitment that you will have to work on this project nor that your contact is committing to be a sponsor, but rather a chance to have a little bit of a group brainstorming project and to help as we will be forming teams around ideas next week.</p>
        <p>Remember to keep these very brief and to the point. A sentence or two or a few bullet points should be sufficient.</p>

        <ol class='checklist'>
            <li><p>Read through <a href="https://byui-cs.github.io/CS246/team-project/overview.html">the Team Project Overview</a> to get an idea of what kinds of projects would fit for this course.</p></li>
            <li><p>Post your idea for a team project on Slack in the #first-thoughts-pitch channel.</p></li>
        </ol>
