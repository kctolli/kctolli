        <p class="subtitle">Singleton Pattern</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Learn about the Singleton pattern.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The Singleton pattern is a rather controversial pattern. On one hand, it is extremely useful, and is used quite a bit. On the other hand, when used incorrectly, the singleton pattern can lead to such bad design that some people refer to the singleton pattern as an anti-pattern.</p>
