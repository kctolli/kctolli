        <p class="subtitle">Shared Preferences in Android</p>

        <h3>Objectives</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Use SharedPreferences in your project to store user data.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This week you'll use the SharedPreferences system to store data that you want to persist between launches of your application, but that isn't large enough to require a database.</p>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        
        <p>The following steps will guide you through this process.</p>
        
        <h4>Part I - Plan what you need to store and store it.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Brainstorm with your team the types of things you should be storing between sessions that aren't database-type items. For example, the user's profile name, the last screen they were looking at, their email address, their favorite number, etc...</p>
                <p>If you were previously thinking of using a database for local storage, consider whether using the shared preferences system, (possibly by serializing a class instance into JSON), would work just as well for your app, without the hassle of setting up a database.</p> 
            </li>
           
            
            <li>
                <p>Write the code necessary to use SharedPreferences to store those items.</p>  
                <p>You could wait until <code>onPause()</code> or <code>onResume()</code> is called, or you could save changes as they occur.</p>
                <p>Make sure you use best practices for your key names, by using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4234129/should-i-use-constants-instead-of-strings-even-if-the-strings-are-only-ever-used">static final strings, rather than "bare strings"</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Part II - Write the code necessary to retrieve the data from Shared Preferences.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Decide the best place to load the data you saved previously (likely in <code>onCreate()</code>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Load the data from shared preferences, and restore the application state as necessary.</p>
                <p>Don't forget to check that the data you're looking for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8757573/android-check-if-value-exists-in-shared-preferences">was actually stored in SharedPreferences</a> (which wouldn't be the case the first time the app is used, for example) and is valid (i.e. not <code>null</code>), before you attempt to use it for something.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Congratulations! You now know how to use SharedPreferences in your Android Project.</p>
