        <h2>12 Prepare : Checkpoint B</h2>

        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="./prepare-f17.html" target="_blank">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This checkpoint will help you practice the syntax of Lambda Functions.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Use lambda functions in combination with map, filter, and reduce functions to perform a series of operations on a list of 100 numbers.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Filter the list to return only those that are even numbers and greater than 33.</p></li>
            <li><p>Map a lambda function to the list that squares each number and then adds one.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce the list to the product of all the numbers (i.e., multiply them all together) using "reduce" and a lambda function.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>To accomplish this, begin with the code found at "<code>/home/cs241/check12b.py</code>". You can copy this to your current directory by typing: <code>cp /home/cs241/check12b.py .</code> (notice the "." at the end.) This code is as follows:</p>

File: check12b.py
Original Author: Brother Burton

Purpose: This file is a starting point to help you practice using lambda functions.

import functools


def get_part1_list():
    """
    Filters a list to return even numbers greater than 33.
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here that uses filter and a lambda function to filter
    # the list so that it only contains even numbers greater than 33.
    new_numbers = []


    return new_numbers

def get_part2_list():
    """
    Maps a lambda function to a list to square each number and add one.
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here than uses map and a lambda function to go through
    # each number in the list, square it and then add one to the result
    new_numbers = []


    return new_numbers

def get_part3_list():
    """
    Reduces a list to its product
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(1, 100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here that uses reduce and a lambda function to
    # multiply all the numbers in the list together and return the product
    product = 0

    return product

def main():
    """
    This function calls the above functions and displays their result.
    """
    print(get_part1_list())
    print(get_part2_list())
    print(get_part3_list())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

        <p>Then, your task is to implement the three functions that produce these lists. You should not need to modify <code>main</code> at all.</p>


        <h3>Testbed</h3>
        <p>
            An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>

        <p>You must use lambda functions for this program in order to receive credit.</p>

        <h4>Helpful commands</h4>
