        <h2>12 Prepare : Checkpoint A</h2>

        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="./prepare-f17.html" target="_blank">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This checkpoint will help you practice the syntax of List Comprehensions.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Write a program that uses a list comprehensions to generate lists for each of the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>A list of the first 100 squares of the numbers [0-99] (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...)</p></li>
            <li><p>A list of the numbers between 0 and 99, inclusive, that are divisible by 5 or 7 (e.g., 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 21, ...).</p></li>
            <li><p>Take a provided list of words and return a list containing only those that have at least 4 letters and that contain the letter 'e'.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>To accomplish this, begin with the code found at "<code>/home/cs241/check12a.py</code>". You can copy this to your current directory by typing: <code>cp /home/cs241/check12a.py .</code> (notice the "." at the end.) This code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
"""
File: check12a.py
Original Author: Brother Burton

Purpose: This file is a starting point to help you practice list comprehensions.
"""

def get_part1_list():
    """
    Returns a list of the squares of the numbers [0-99], e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ...]
    """
    numbers = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return numbers

def get_part2_list():
    """
    Returns a list of the the numbers [0-99] that are divisible by either 5 or 7
    """
    numbers = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return numbers

def get_part3_list():
    """
    Filters a list of words to return only those that are at least 4 letters long and contain an 'e'
    """
    old_words = ["tacos", "knowledge", "water", "on", "the", "I", "is", "hilarious", "tie", "coat", "white", "covenants", "phone", "rubric", "send", "restrictions"]

    new_words = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return new_words

def main():
    """
    This function calls the above functions and displays their result.
    """
    print(get_part1_list())
    print(get_part2_list())
    print(get_part3_list())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

        <p>Then, your task is to implement the three functions that produce these lists. You should not need to modify <code>main</code> at all.</p>

        <h3>Testbed</h3>
        <p>
            An auto-grading testbed script is provided for you to help evaluate your program. This same testbed script will be used to grade your program. It is pass/fail, so your program must pass the testbed completely for you to receive credit for this assignment. You may run the testbed as many times as you like.
        </p>

        <p>You must use list comprehensions for this program in order to receive credit.</p>

        <h4>Helpful commands</h4>
<pre><code class="bash">
