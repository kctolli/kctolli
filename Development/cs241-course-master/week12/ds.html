        <p class="subtitle">Lambda Functions</p>

        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of lambda functions.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use lambda functions in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Many modern languages make use of anonymous functions (functions that don't actually have a name), and often these are called lambda functions. Python provides for Lambda functions, and makes use of them for functions such as, filter, map, and reduce.</p>

        <p>As you will see in the reading, there is some discussion about the need for these, and whether using something else like list comprehensions would be preferred in a given situation. That said, while not a tool for every job, list comprehensions are very useful in many circumstances.</p>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>Please read the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php" target="_blank">Lambda, Filter, Reduce, and Map</a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/890128/why-are-python-lambdas-useful" target="_blank">Stack Overflow: Why are Python Lambdas Useful?</a></p></li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Programming Assignment</h3>
        <p>Practice using lambda functions.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Use lambda functions in combination with map, filter, and reduce functions to perform a series of operations on a list of 100 numbers.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Filter the list to return only those that are even numbers and greater than 33.</p></li>
            <li><p>Map a lambda function to the list that squares each number and then adds one.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce the list to the product of all the numbers (i.e., multiply them all together) using "reduce" and a lambda function.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>To accomplish this, begin with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
"""
Purpose: This file is a starting point to help you practice using lambda functions.
"""

import functools


def get_part1_list():
    """
    Filters a list to return even numbers greater than 33.
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here that uses filter and a lambda function to filter
    # the list so that it only contains even numbers greater than 33.
    new_numbers = []


    return new_numbers

def get_part2_list():
    """
    Maps a lambda function to a list to square each number and add one.
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here than uses map and a lambda function to go through
    # each number in the list, square it and then add one to the result
    new_numbers = []


    return new_numbers

def get_part3_list():
    """
    Reduces a list to its product
    """
    numbers = [x for x in range(1, 100)]

    # TODO: Write a line here that uses reduce and a lambda function to
    # multiply all the numbers in the list together and return the product
    product = 0

    return product

def main():
    """
    This function calls the above functions and displays their result.
    """
    print(get_part1_list())
    print(get_part2_list())
    print(get_part3_list())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

        <p>Then, your task is to implement the three functions that produce these lists. You should not need to modify <code>main</code> at all.</p>


        <h4>Testing your program</h4>
        <p>An automated testBed script is not available for your program. Instead, please manually test your program and ensure that it works correctly.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>

        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
