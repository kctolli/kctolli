        <h2>12 Prepare : Checkpoint B</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>After completing (or <i>while</i> completing) the <a href="./prepare.html" target="_blank">preparation material</a> for this week, complete the following exercise.
        </p>

        <p>This checkpoint is intended to help you practice the mechanics of working with the Pandas library, and help you on your assignment for the week.</p>
       
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>For this checkpoint, we will use the movies data set that you are using for your weekly assignment. If you haven't already, please follow the instructions on <a href="../week13/prove.html" target="_blank">the assignment page</a> to download that dataset.</p>

        <h4>Programming Assignment</h4>
        <p>It's hard to notice, but in this data set, when you use the MPAA column that has the MPAA ratings (R, PG, etc.), these values have a space in front of them, so they are <code>" R"</code> instead of <code>"R"</code>.</p>
        <p>Your assignment is to use the <code>.apply()</code> function and a custom lambda function to modify all the values in this column to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.</p>

        <h3>Helpful hints:</h3>

        <h4>Using the Apply Function</h4>
        <p>The apply function is very similar to the "map" function that we saw in a previous data structures assignment. You can run a predefined function on each item in a column:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def append_stuff(value):
    return value + "_stuff"

data.mpaa.apply(append_stuff)

# Notice that we don't put () at the end of append_stuff, because
# we are not calling the function, but rather passing the name of
# the function that will be called later
</code></pre>

        <p>The above code will call the append_stuff function on every value in the mpaa column, and add the text "_stuff" to it. This will not <em>change</em> those values, however. To save it for later, you either need to create a new column, or overwrite the original column:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# Create a new column (this requires using the [] notation)
data["mpaa_stuff"] = data.mpaa.apply(append_stuff)

# Overwrite the old column (this could be done with either the [] or . notation)
data.mpaa = data.mpaa.apply(append_stuff)
</code></pre>

        <h4>Removing whitespace</h4>
        <p>Python has built-in functions for removing leading and trailing whitespace from a string. Search the Internet to see if you can find one, rather than creating your own logic to do this.</p>

        <h4>Lambda Functions</h4>
        <p>As you might observe, creating a function like this is a perfect scenario to use a lambda function. Please refer to this week's <a href="./ds.html" target="_blank">data structures homework</a> for more information about lambda functions.</p>

        <h3>Testing your solution</h3>
        <p>Before you run any code, if you look at the value counts for the ratings you will see this:</p>


<pre><code class="bash">
data.mpaa.value_counts()

          53864
 R         3377
 PG-13     1003
 PG         528
 NC-17       16
</code></pre>

        <p>After running your code, if you look at the value counts again, you should see this:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
data.mpaa.value_counts()

           53864
R          3377
PG-13      1003
PG          528
NC-17        16
</code></pre>

        
        <p>Notice the slight difference that there is no longer a space at the beginning of the line.</p>

        <p>In addition, please test your code by filtering the movies to find out the number of PG movies using the following:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pg_movies = data[data.mpaa == "PG"]
print(len(pg_movies))
</code></pre>

        <p>If you have done it correctly, you should see 528. If you have not, you will see 0.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have completed this work, report your progress on the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
