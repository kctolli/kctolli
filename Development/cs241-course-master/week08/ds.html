        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of trees.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use trees in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This week, we will be discussing the <em>tree</em> data structure. Trees are a very important and commonly used data structure in computer science. To prepare for our discussion, you need to read over several things to get the basic ideas.</p>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>

        <p>First, become familiar with basic terminology, by reading the the following sections from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on Trees</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The introduction</p></li>
            <li><p>Definition</p></li>
            <li><p>Terminology used in trees (this is a list of the terms)</p></li>
            <li><p>Terminology (this is a different section a little further down)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Trees</h4>
        <p>Trees provide a way of organizing our data hierarchically, where we have root node at the top, and then every node in the tree can have its own child nodes. In discrete math terms, we could refer to this as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), because their is a direction implied from parents to children and the tree cannot contain cycles, or loops, where a child contains as a child its own parent or grandparent.</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-tree.png" alt="Tree" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>We can store any type of data that we would like in the tree, including our own complex classes. The node data structure itself contains the data, and then a list of child nodes.</p>

        <div class="class-diagrams">
            <table class="table-class-diagram">
                <tr><th>TreeNode</th></tr>
                <tr><td>data</td></tr>
                <tr><td>child_nodes : TreeNode[]</td>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>In a tree, there is no limit to the number of children a single node can have, and no requirement as to how things are organized. In order to find a node in a tree, you may need to traverse the entire tree to see if it is there.</p>

        <p>There are lots of examples of trees in computers, consider for example a file system directory structure.</p>

        <p>In summary, the essential elements of a Tree are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Each node can have 0 or more children</p></li>
            <li><p>There are no cycles</p></li>
            <li><p>The program keeps track of the root node, and all others can be found starting from that point.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Binary Trees</h4>
        <p>A useful limitation to place on trees (as we shall see later) is to restrict each node to have at most two children. These trees are called Binary Trees.</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-binary-tree.png" alt="Binary Tree" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>Typically, in a binary tree, we refer to the children as the "left child" and the "right child." And the node data structure could be defined as:</p>

        <div class="class-diagrams">
            <table class="table-class-diagram">
                <tr><th>BinaryTreeNode</th></tr>
                <tr><td>data</td></tr>
                <tr><td>left : BinaryTreeNode</td>
                <tr><td>right : BinaryTreeNode</td>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>Because binary trees do not specify anything about the ordering of elements in the tree, in order to find something, in the worst case, you have to traverse through all the nodes of the tree: <code>O(n)</code> time complexity.</p>

        <p>Binary trees have all the properties of Trees, with the following additional restriction:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>Binary Tree nodes may have 0, 1, or 2 children.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Binary Search Trees</h4>
        <p>Binary trees become more interesting when we add one further restriction, namely that the value of the data stored by a node must be greater than everything in its left subtree, and less than everything in its right subtree. This restriction of ordering makes this a Binary Search Tree (BST).</p>

        <p>The ordering restriction is very important, because it makes it so that we can find things efficiently in the tree. For example, consider finding the element 42 in the following tree:</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-find42.png" alt="BST finding 42" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>Starting at the root, we can check to see if it is our value (42). Because it's not a match, we must look down the left or right subtree, but because of the ordering restriction, we know that 42 could not be in the left subtree, so we can rule all of those nodes out, and focus exclusively on the right sub tree.</p>

        <p>We then check the next node, and go right or left depending on the whether our value is less than or greater than the node in question. If we make it to the end of the tree and didn't find the correct node, then we know that it is not in the tree, because if it were, we would have found it.</p>

        <p>As with finding a node in the tree, inserting a node into the tree also has a defined pattern, and there is only one place that it can be inserted. Consider the following illustration of adding 27 into the tree.</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-insert27.png" alt="BST inserting 27" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>This is important. When adding a node to a tree, there is exactly one place where it can go.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the order that we add items is important. Consider adding the values 11, 25, 8, 16, 95, 73 in that order to produce the following tree:</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-inserted-oneway.png" alt="BST inserted one way" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>If the same numbers were added in this order, 73, 95, 16, 8, 25, 11, then we would instead see this tree:</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-inserted-backwards.png" alt="BST inserted backwards" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>Both of these trees are valid BST's for that data, but they show the difference of inserting the data in a different order.</p>

        <p>In summary, Binary Search Trees have all the properties of Binary Trees, with one additional restriction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>A nodes value must be greater than all those in the left subtree and less than all those in the right subtree.</p></li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Balanced Binary Search Trees</h4>
        <p>Because of the ordering restriction of a Binary Search Tree, it is easy to find an item, without having to look through every node in the tree. However, consider the following valid binary search tree:</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-linkedlist.png" alt="BST that looks like a linked list" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>This is a valid BST, but in essence it is a linked list, and finding an element in this tree still requires <code>O(n)</code> time in the worst case. On the other hand, as long as the tree is relatively balanced, at each step, we could rule out half of the nodes, and then half again:</p>

        <img src="./img/ds-bst-logn.png" alt="BST showing log-n" class="img-tutorial">

        <p>The result of this is that if the tree is balanced, we can find items in <code>O(log n)</code> time in the worst case. This is a huge improvement!</p>

        <p>Balanced Binary Search Trees (Balanced BSTs) add a restriction to BSTs that the height of the two subtrees of a node can differ by at most 1. This does not require the tree to be perfectly complete and symmetric, but it does require it to be fairly evenly balanced.</p>

        <p>Maintaining this balance requires a little bit of work. If something ever happens that would cause the tree to get out of balanced, it needs to be rebalanced. The only two operations that can cause this problem are adding to the tree and removing a node from the tree. And in these cases, the only nodes that could possibly be out of balance are the ancestors of those nodes added or deleted. Because of this, we don't have to check every node in the tree for balance each time a change is made, just a small subset of them (<code>O (log n)</code>).</p>

        <p>When we find a node that is out of balance, there are clever ways to re-balance them. Two common approaches are Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees. If you are curious about the details of these approaches, you can read up on them further, but it is sufficient for us at this point to know that there are relatively straightforward algorithms that can help us re-balance the tree, and allow it to still have <code>O(log n)</code> insertion, deletion, and retrieval time.</p>

        <p>In summary, Balanced Binary Search Trees have all the properties of a Binary Search Tree, with the following additional restriction:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>All nodes in a Balanced Binary Search Tree can have a difference of at most 1 in the height of their left and right sub-trees.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Using Trees in Python</h3>
        <p>Many languages have a built-in library that uses Trees for sets or dictionaries, however in Python hash tables are used for those (which we will learn about later).</p>

        <h3>Homework Assignment</h3>
        <p>Use a recursive function to visit each node in a provided tree, and print out the values in order.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps to guide you through the process:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Begin with the following starter code. It defines a TreeNode class, and constructs a simple binary search tree for you.</p></li>

<pre><code class="bash">
# For this assignment, you just need to implement the print_tree() function

class TreeNode:
    """
    This class holds a basic binary tree node
    For this assignment, you should not need to change the class.
    """
    def __init__(self, data=""):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def construct_tree():
    """
    This function constructs a simple balanced binary search tree.
    Normally, we would add functions to our tree to be able to automatically insert
    the values into the correct places, but for this assignment, this
    function will simply construct it manually.

</code></pre>

            <li><p>The provided code defines a method called "print_tree" that receives the root of the node. Your task is to fill out the body of this method so that it prints out every element of the tree in order. (Please note that the tree has been constructed in order, so you should not need to ever compare any values yourself to see which is less and which is greater, rather follow the branches of the tree appropriately, and it will be done for you.)</p>

            <p>Your function should be a recursive function that calls itself on each of the child nodes. Don't forget to include a base case to handle the situation when the function is call on an empty "None" node.</p>

            <p>You should not use a for or while loop in your code. Instead, use recursion to accomplish iterating through all of the nodes.</p>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>Please note that you can likely find many examples on the Internet that do this, but try to figure it out on your own before turning to them.</p>
