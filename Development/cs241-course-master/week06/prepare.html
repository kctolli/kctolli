        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this week, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Show fluency in discussing inheritance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Write programs that correctly use inheritance to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>Please read the following:</p>

        <h4>Python 3 Inheritance Syntax at a Glance</h4>
        <p>The reading above made use of the syntax of inheritance. In its simplest form, here is what you need to do to create a derived class:</p>

        <p>We first need to define the base class. Nothing fancy here:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
class Product:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define any member variables that are shared among all
        # derived classes
        self.price = 0.0
        self.quantity = 0

    # We can also define any methods that are shared among all classes

    def get_total_price(self):
        return self.price * self.quantity
</code></pre>

<p>We now define a derived class (or multiple derived classes)</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# Notice that we put Product in parentheses to show they we are inheriting from it
class Cereal(Product):
    def __init__(self):
        # We override the base class __init__ function to declare any cereal-specific
        # member variables. Notice that we MUST call the super().__init__ function
        # to ensure that the member variables in the base class also get set up.

        # First call the base class version
        super().__init__()

        # Now, set up any member variables
        self.weight = 0.0

    # We can also define any functions that are specific to the cereal class.

    def calculate_shipping_cost(self):
        return 0.05 * self.weight
</code></pre>

<p>With these classes in place, we can now create an instance of type cereal and use any methods or properties defined in either the base or the derived class:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
corn_flakes = Cereal()
corn_flakes.price = 3.49
corn_flakes.quantity = 1
corn_flakes.weight = 2.05

price = corn_flakes.get_total_price()
cost = corn_flakes.calculate_shipping_cost()
</code></pre>
