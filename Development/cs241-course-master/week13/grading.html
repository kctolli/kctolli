        <h2>13 Prove : Assessment Guidelines</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This document outlines the guidelines for instructors and teaching assistants to use as they assess the assignment. It is intended to give structure and guidance to the grading process to ensure that the most important components of the assignment are highlighted, and to promote consistency across sections.</p>

        <p>In all cases, the instructor has the latitude to deviate from this rubric on a case-by-base basis to provide the holistic assessment that, in their judgment, best matches the assignment.</p>

        <h3>Fundamental Concepts</h3>
        <p>This assignment is designed to highlight the following fundamental concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Use of libraries</p></li>
            <li><p>Finding solutions to unfamiliar concepts</p></li>
            <li><p>Filtering / Lambda functions</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Approach</h3>
        <p>This assignment is different from most in the course, because the students are not submitting a program, full of functions and objects. Instead, they will submit a PDF with code snippets, graphs, and analysis.</p>

        <p>Because of this, the assignment is graded holistically, based on the things they were able to accomplish. Please look to make sure they have reasonable code, plots, and analysis. </p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <p>Assuming all the components are present, the following broad scale is used for this assignment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>70% - Finished Part 1 with correct plots and analysis.</p></li>
            <li><p>85% - Finished Part 2 with correct plots and analysis.</p></li>
            <li><p>100% - Finished Part 3 with correct plots and analysis.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Missing elements or poor quality in any section can reduce the score to somewhere in between the thresholds listed above.</p>
