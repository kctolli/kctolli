        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>At the end of this study, successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Show fluency in discussing list comprehensions.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use list comprehensions in Python to solve problems.</p></li>
        </ol>  

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>A Python feature that is commonly used to filter, generate, and manipulate lists is that of List Comprehensions.</p>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>

        <p>Please read the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-list-comprehension" target="_blank">DataCamp: Python List Comprehensions</a> - Please skip the section entitled "Lambda Functions with map(), filter() and reduce()", we will read about them next week...</p></li>
                <li><p>(Optional) <a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/" target="_blank">Python List Comprehensions: Explained Visually</a> - You can refer to this for further explanation, if you would like.</p></li>

            </ul>

        <h3>Programming Assignment</h3>
        <p>Practice using list comprehensions.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Write a program that uses a list comprehensions to generate lists for each of the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>A list of the first 100 squares of the numbers [0-99] (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...)</p></li>
            <li><p>A list of the numbers between 0 and 99, inclusive, that are divisible by 5 or 7 (e.g., 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 21, ...).</p></li>
            <li><p>Take a provided list of words and return a list containing only those that have at least 4 letters and that contain the letter 'e'.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>To accomplish this, begin with the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
"""
Purpose: This file is a starting point to help you practice list comprehensions.
"""

def get_part1_list():
    """
    Returns a list of the squares of the numbers [0-99], e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ...]
    """
    numbers = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return numbers

def get_part2_list():
    """
    Returns a list of the the numbers [0-99] that are divisible by either 5 or 7
    """
    numbers = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return numbers

def get_part3_list():
    """
    Filters a list of words to return only those that are at least 4 letters long and contain an 'e'
    """
    old_words = ["tacos", "knowledge", "water", "on", "the", "I", "is", "hilarious", "tie", "coat", "white", "covenants", "phone", "rubric", "send", "restrictions"]

    new_words = [] # TODO: Change this line to be a list comprehension

    return new_words

def main():
    """
    This function calls the above functions and displays their result.
    """
    print(get_part1_list())
    print(get_part2_list())
    print(get_part3_list())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

        <p>Your task is to insert list comprehensions into the 3 places noted. Then, verify that your program displays the correct results.</p>


        <h4>Testing your program</h4>
        <p>An automated testBed script is not available for your program. Instead, please manually test your program and ensure that it works correctly.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You are encouraged to work with others on the programming and the quiz.</p>

        <p>When you have a good understanding of this data structure and have completed the programming project, take the accompanying I-Learn Quiz. It has questions about how the data structure works, and also, has places for your to report on the parts of the programming assignment that you completed.</p>
