        <h2>11 Teach : Team Activity - </h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This week's team activity will be different than most. The purpose of the activity is for you to help each other complete your projects.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Meet together for an hour like usual. During this meeting you will share various pieces of your projects with your teammates.</p>

        <p>If you haven't completed a section, <strong>do not simply copy and paste the solution into your own code</strong>, but instead, with your code closed, and without taking pictures, etc., look over your teammates' code and listen to their description, so that then after the meeting you have some ideas that you can go implement on your own.</p>
        
        <p>Please do the following:</p>

        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Have each person demonstrate how they handle the firing of bullets.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have each person demonstrate how they handle having the ship no longer display or be able to shoot after it has died.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have each person demonstrate how they handle collisions. Make sure to highlight both the components in the Game class and also those in the Rock classes.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move on to the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Have each person demonstrate one extra feature they are working on / considering.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have each person demonstrate a second extra feature they are working on / considering.</p></li>
            <li><p>As a team discuss several (3-5) other things you could potentially add to this project if you had a few more weeks to work on it.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>There is no instructor solution for this assignment. Looking at your teammates code will count for that, so you may go ahead and mark the box that you have done this.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
