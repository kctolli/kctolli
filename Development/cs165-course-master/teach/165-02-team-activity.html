        <h1>02 Teach : Team Activity - Structs</h1>

        <div class="online-notes">

            <h3>Special Instructions for Online Students</h3>

            <p>This week, because you are still in the process of forming teams and coordinating your weekly meeting time, you will NOT complete this activity with your teams.</p>

            <p>However, to help you understand the process of how the team activities will work each week, you will still complete this activity including the assessment in I-Learn. For this week's assessment, you can answer "True" to the questions about arriving on-time to the meeting with your team, and actively participating with them. Thus, you will see the expectation for the team activities for each week in the future.</p>

            <p>Even though you will be completing this week's activity individually, please help one another in the developer's forum. (Hint: these are double points, because you are earning your participation points for the week and also completing this activity!)</p>

            <h3>Face-to-face Students</h3>
            <p>This activity is designed to be completed during class.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>As a team, create a struct for a scripture that contains a book, chapter, and verse. Then, write a function to display a scripture, and one to prompt for a scripture.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Divide your teams into groups of 2-3. You should all work together on one laptop, then make sure everyone in your team gets a copy of the work that you complete.</p>
        
        <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Create a <code>struct</code> to hold a <code>Scripture</code>. It should have 3 members, a string for the book name, an integer for the chapter, and an integer for the verse.</li>

            <li>In main, create a <code>Scripture</code> and assign it the values Alma 31:5. (Make sure it compiles)</li>

            <li>Write a function: "<code>displayScripture</code>" that displays a given scripture in the form: <code>book chapter:verse</code> (e.g. "<code>John 3:16</code>").</li>

            <li>Pass your Alma 31:5 scripture to the display function, run the program and make sure it appears correctly on the screen.</li>

            <li>Write a function: "<code>promptScripture</code>" that prompts the user for a book, chapter, verse, and assigns it to a new scripture.</li>

            <li>Change main so that it calls <code>promptScripture</code> and then passes the struct to <code>displayScripture</code>. Try different values and make sure they display correctly</li>

            <li>Show your code to your instructor to "pass it off"</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move onto the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Change your program so that it handles books with spaces in them (e.g., "1 Nephi").</li>
            <li>Change your program so that it creates an array of 3 scriptures. Then have it loop through and prompt the user for each of these scriptures, filling the array. Finally have it loop through and display each of these scriptures.</li>
            <li>Create an additional struct called, Insight that has two elements, a Scripture (our struct from above), and a string message that contains insight about that scripture. Add a promptInsight and displayInsight function that in turn call the functions from above.</li>
        </ol>


        <h1>Completion</h1>
        <p>By following the steps above, you should complete and report on the following:</p>

        <p>Core Requirements:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><code>Scripture</code> struct created</li>
            <li><code>displayScripture</code> function</li>
            <li><code>promptScripture</code> function</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Stretch Challenges: (Make sure everyone on your team is done with their core features before working on these.)</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Book handles spaces</li>
            <li>Array of 3 Scriptures</li>
            <li>Insight struct (that contains a Scripture)</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byui-burton/cs165-course/master/teach/165-02-ta-solution.cpp" target="_BLANK">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>

        <p>Please be aware that if you leave a question in the I-Learn quiz blank, it will warn you about it when you submit the quiz. So, for example, if you don't complete any of the stretch challenges, it warns you that this question has been left blank. In this case, you can ignore the warning, and proceed to submit the quiz.</p>
