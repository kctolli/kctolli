        <h1>13 Teach : Team Activity - The Rule of Three</h1>


        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>This activity will help you practice the syntax of copy constructors, assignment operators, and destructors.</p>

        <p>Your assignment is to implement each of these for a Course class that contains a dynamically allocated array of Students.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>Begin with the code at: <code>/home/cs165new/ta13/*</code></p>

        <p>This code includes the following two classes:</p>

        <div class="class-diagrams">
            <table class="table-class-diagram">
                <tr><th>Course</th></tr>
                <tr><td>-name : string</td></tr>
                <tr><td>-classList : Student*</td></tr>
                <tr><td>-size : int</td></tr>
                <tr class='class-diagram-spacer'><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>+getName() : string</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+setName(string) : void</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+getSize() : int</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+setSize(int) : void</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+getStudent(int index) : Student</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+setStudent(int index, const Student &amp;) : void</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+displayList(Student) : void</td></tr>
            </table>
            <table class="table-class-diagram">
                <tr><th>Student</th></tr>
                <tr><td>id : int</td></tr>
                <tr><td>name : string</td></tr>
                <tr class='class-diagram-spacer'><td></td></tr>
                <tr><td>+getId() : int</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+getName() : string</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+setId(int) : void</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+setName(string) : void</td></tr>
                <tr><td>+display() : void</td></tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>Notice that because a Course has a dynamically allocated array, it needs a destructor, a copy constructor, and an overloaded assignment operator.</p>

        <h2>Core Requirements</h2>


        <ol>
            <li>Implement a constructor that takes an integer for the size. It should set the size member variable and then allocate the array of Students to that size. Then, implement the <code>getStudent</code> and <code>setStudent</code> methods of the Course class that should get and set students at the specified index (e.g., <code>setStudent(3, john)</code> should set <code>john</code> to be at index 3 in the array).</li>

            <li>Implement a destructor for the Course class that deallocates the array. Then, display a message, "Cleaning up course: [course-name]". Please note that in practice we would not actually output a message when cleaning up a message, but while practicing this helps us see that it is actually being called.</li>

            <li>Implement a copy constructor for the Course class that performs a deep copy (i.e., allocates a new array and copies each student over). Also, overload the assignment operator for the Course class to perform a deep copy.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>When you complete these requirements, show your code to your instructor to "pass it off."</p>

        <h2>Stretch Challenges</h2>
        <p> After completing the above steps. Make sure that everyone on the entire team is to this point and understands the material. Then, if you have time, move onto the following stretch challenges.</p>

        <p></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Overload the output operator for both <code>Student</code> and <code>Course</code>. Remove the display functions for each and replace any references to it with calls to your output operator.</li>
            <li>Change the <code>Student</code> class to use a dynamically allocated <code>char[]</code> for the name instead of a object of the <code>string</code> class. Leave the parameters and the return type of getName and setName as they were, but change the bodies of these functions to convert between the character array and the string data types.</li>
            <li>Because the <code>Student</code> class now has dynamically allocated data, implement a destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator for it as well. See if you can add something to the driver program to test that your code is working the way you expect.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Instructor's Solution</h1>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs165-course/tree/master/teach/165-13-ta-solution" target="_BLANK">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>


        <h1>Submission</h1>
        <p>You do not need to submit your program (just make sure that everyone has a copy of it for their reference). Instead, answer the accompanying questions in the I-Learn quiz.</p>
