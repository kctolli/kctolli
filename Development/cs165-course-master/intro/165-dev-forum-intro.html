        <h1>Participation in the Developer's Forum</h1>
<p>Class participation points are awarded according to activity on the forum. Each topic of this semester will have a forum on which you can find answers to many of your questions and where you can help others with their challenges. The forum is modeled after a developer forum.</p>
<p>A developer forum is a place where programmers with similar interests go to ask questions, provide insight, and express opinions (please see the <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vclanguage/threads" target="_blank">MSDN's Visual C++ Language</a> forum for an example). When the community of developers active in a forum is large enough, you can expect answers to most questions in a short amount of time. The trick to making a community work, of course, is to give as much as you get. In other words, everyone should strive to be a contributor, not just a consumer.</p>
<h2>Being a Great Contributor</h2>
<hr />
<p>The key to being a great forum contributor is to give targeted responses that are both correct and insightful. A few suggestions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Target:</strong> Make sure you are answering the correct question. This typically means one or two careful reads of the question and all related threads. If you are unsure of what the questions are, respond to the post with a request for clarification. This is typically done best by saying, "Are you asking about ___ or ___ or ___?"</li>
<li><strong>Correct:</strong> Take a minute to verify your response. In most cases, this involves writing a short program to verify your solution or to look up the answer in the text. Include your program or a quote from your source in your response.</li>
<li><strong>Insightful:</strong> Great posts not only answer the question being stated, but they take advantage of the teaching opportunity the post offers. In summary, take a moment to answer the "why" questions as well.</li>
<li><strong>Tactful:</strong> Remember you are communicating with another person. Be friendly. Reach out to them. Remember, they may be answering your question in a couple days.</li>
<li><strong>Clear:</strong> Take a moment to re-read your post. Does it make sense? Is there a way you can re-word your comments to make it clearer? Does it appear professional?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be a Great Asker</h2>
<hr />
<p>It is often more difficult to ask a great question than it is to provide an answer. The quality of the your questions responses is directly related to how well you posed the question in the first place. A few suggestions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific:</strong> Each question should be focused on a specific problem. General questions, such as "I have no idea how floats work," are difficult to answer. More specific ones, such as "What is the difference between a float and a double," is much more likely to give you the answer you are looking for. Spend a minute to make sure you know exactly what answer you want and if your question will lead toward that answer.</li>
<li><strong>Complete:</strong> Make sure all the information necessary to answer the question is present in the question. This typically includes code snippets illustrating your question.</li>
<li><strong>Polite:</strong> Remember that you are asking for help. Please be careful to avoid a demanding tone. Be respectful, kind, and gracious. This can be difficult when you are frustrated!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<hr />
<p>To illustrate this process, two examples will be presented. In the first example, the student is unsure of why his first assignment is not compiling. In the second, the student is looking for a better way to do an assignment.</p>
<h3>EXAMPLE 1: COMPILE ERROR</h3>
<p>Sam is working on his first C++ program is not sure about the syntax of the language. To compound the problem, all the tools are unfamiliar and somewhat intimidating. He needs help and turns to the forum to find it.</p>
<h4>Ask: An incomplete post</h4>
<p>Sam poses the following question on the forum:</p>
<p>My program can't compile, and I don't know why. Can someone help?</p>
<p>There are several problems with this post. The first is that it is incomplete; the reader does not have enough information to provide any meaningful insight. The best thing to do when encountering a post like this is to politely request information and express a willingness to help.</p>
<h4>Ask: A post lacking politeness</h4>
<p>Sam is frustrated! After spending a half hour on his assignment, he still is making little headway. Still struggling with the same compile error, he turns to the forum for help.</p>
<p>This stupid compiler never works! What is wrong this time?</p>
<pre>example.cpp: In function &acirc;int main()&acirc;:
</pre>
<pre>example.cpp:5: error &acirc;cout&acirc; was not declared in this scope<br />
</pre>
<p>There is a demanding tone to this post. Sam needs to remember that the reader of the post is not responsible for his errors; Sam is!</p>
<p>Observe how this question is much more targeted, but there is still room for improvement. We can see what the error is (cout is not declared), but are unsure why. It could be because the iostream library was not included, it could be because there is a missing namespace statement, or there may be a typo somewhere in the program. Again, the best response to this question is to ask for more information.</p>
<h4>Ask: A great question</h4>
<p>Sam makes a final attempt to ask his question:</p>
<p>I am having trouble getting my assignment to compile. The code is:</p>
<pre>#include <iostream>int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world\n"; return 0;}<br />
</iostream></pre>
<p>The compile error is:</p>
<pre>example.cpp: In function &acirc;int main()&acirc;:
</pre>
<pre>example.cpp:5: error &acirc;cout&acirc; was not declared in this scope<br />
</pre>
<p>Though the error is on the cout line, I don't think that is the problem. It looks exactly like the examples!</p>
<p>This is a great question. It is polite and respectful: humility is present in the post. It is specific: there is no question of what Sam is asking for. Finally, it is complete. With both the code and the compile error, all the required information is present.</p>
<h4>Answer: Erroneous</h4>
<p>Sue is eager to finish the first programming activity of the class and get on with the more interesting stuff. She reluctantly goes into the forum to answer a few questions so she can get her participation points.</p>
<p>Sam, you spelled cout wrong!</p>
<p>There are two things wrong with this post. First, it is not very tactful. Sue is making Sam feel small with this post, making his problem seem trivial and beneath her. It would do Sue well to remember that she was a beginner once! Remember, reaching out is always better than putting people down.</p>
<p>The second thing wrong with this post is that it is incorrect. The problem with the code is not that cout was spelled incorrectly. It seems that she only read the compile error rather than taking the time to understand the problem. Sue will receive zero points for this post, and the moderator will probably remove it.</p>
<h4>Answer: Correct but not insightful</h4>
<p>Sue finds Sam's post and is slightly puzzled; the code looks right! She copies the code from the post and puts it in a C++ file. Sure enough, there is a compile error! Looking closer, she sees that something missing:</p>
<p>Sam, you are missing the "namespace" statement placed near the beginning of the program:</p>
<pre>#include <iostream>
</iostream></pre>
<pre>using namespace std; // this is missing!
</pre>
<pre>int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world\n"; return 0;}<br />
</pre>
<p>This response is correct and it completely answers Sam's question. However, it did not help him to make the connection between the compile error he saw and the flaw in his code. In other words, Sue helped Sam get over his problem, but she did not help him learn. This will be a 30pt response.</p>
<h4>Answer: A great response</h4>
<p>Sue spots the error with Sam's program and takes a moment to see what the textbook says on the subject before responding to the post.</p>
<p>Sam, you are missing the "namespace" statement placed near the beginning of the program:</p>
<pre>#include <iostream>using namespace std; // We need this with all our programsint main(){ cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world\n";return 0;}<br /><br /></iostream></pre>
<p>You can read about this on page 3 and 4 of Lecture 0.2. Briefly, the "long name" of cout is std::cout. Without the "using namespace std;" statement, the compiler expects us to use the long version. With the namespace statement, we are allowed to use the short version: cout.</p>
<p>This response is personal (calling Sam by his first name), correct, and insightful. Sue will get a full 50 points for this response.</p>
<h3>EXAMPLE 2: OPTIMIZATION</h3>
<p>In this second example, Sue is working a program to compute the change (number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) for a given dollar amount. While it works, she feels there must be a better way. To get help, she turns to the forum.</p>
<h4>Ask: An inappropriate question</h4>
<p>Sue posts the following question to the forum:</p>
<p>Has anyone found a way to get the number of quarters for the change-maker assignment?</p>
<p>There are two main problems with this post. The first is that the reader is put in a bind. Should he just give Sue the answer or risk frustrating her by giving a hint? The best thing Sam can do in this situation is to ignore the post.</p>
<p>The second problem is that it is inappropriate to ask another student to do your work for you. Please don't ask another student to help you cheat! Don't ask questions that would encourage someone to give you the solution to a homework assignment. Instead, keep your questions more general.</p>
<h4>Ask: Too much information</h4>
<p>Sue wants to make it clear that she has got an acceptable answer but wonders if there is a better answer available:</p>
<p>I solved the change-maker assignment but wonder if there is a better way. My code is:</p>
<pre>int getQuarters(float dollars){ return (int)(dollars*100)/25;}<br />
</pre>
<p>Remember that our posts are visible for the entire class to see. Please do not post solutions to assignments. We do not want to create an environment where people are tempted to cheat.</p>
<h4>Ask: A great question</h4>
<p>Sue makes a final attempt to ask her question:</p>
<p>There seems to be more than one way to solve the changemaker assignment. I just can't decide which is best. My first approach is to write a function for every computation (like getQuarters() and getQuartersRemainders()), but that seems like a ton of code.What is best? Should I write one large function or a bunch of smaller ones?</p>
<p>Notice how all the students in the class can feel free to chime-in without risking giving away the answer to the assignment. Seeing this question, Sam is eager to answer.</p>
<h4>Answer: Stating an opinion as if it was a fact</h4>
<p>Sam is eager to make a good impression on the teacher and the other classmates. Seeing Sue's question, he is quick to respond:</p>
<p>Sue, just put everything in one function. Too many functions just make the code difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Sam's comments violate the principle of Modularization, a concept that we will learn about in Section 2. It is unclear whether he got this opinion from a teacher, a friend, or from his own experience. Opinions are fine as long as others know it is an opinion. We certainly do not want to lead people astray. Sam will receive zero posts for this function and the moderator will probably need to clarify it.</p>
<h4>Answer: Too much information</h4>
<p>Sam decides to read ahead before answering the question:</p>
<p>Sue, the answer to this question is the principle of Cohesion. You can read about it in the 2.0 videos. If you put all the code in one function, you will likely be experiencing Temporal Cohesion where functional is possible. However, if you make a ton of individual functions, then you won't be much better. The main function might be Temporal but the individual functions would be Functional. Even if you do address the problem, then the Coupling challenges become apparent...</p>
<p>Sam has strayed from answering Sue's question and is showing off. While his comments are factually correct, they are likely not going to be too meaningful to Sue who has not yet looked into the reading weeks in advance. This will either encourage Sue to feel behind and clueless or prompt her into reading ahead. Sam will probably receive 10 or 20 points for this post.</p>
<h4>Answer: A great response</h4>
<p>Sam answers with:</p>
<p>Sue, most of the examples in the text seem to have between three and ten lines of code (see lesson15.cpp and lesson16.cpp). I don't see many that are much longer or shorter than that. It seems to that the one function design for this problem is much simpler and more elegant than a design with ten functions. Does anyone else have some insight here?</p>
<p>This post seems to stem from a legitimate desire on Sam's part to help Sue. It directs her to information that will help her make an informed decision and it invites others to response. This will be a 40 or 50 point post.</p>
