        <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/7e8609cb-3efc-47c5-937f-4bd44c4e711a/1/index.html" target="_BLANK">Linux System Remote Access</a> department page. It will give you information about how to get connected to the CS Department Linux System.</p>

        <p>A few special considerations as the Linux system has changed recently:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The IP address range has changed to 157.201.194.201-210 (it was formerly 201-235).</li>
            <li>If you use emacs with a client that passes through the graphics (e.g., Moba or Mac with the -X switch), it will open up a graphical version of emacs on your local system. This may be what you want, because it allows for use of the mouse, etc. But if you are away from campus, it will likely be very delayed. If you want to force emacs to open in the regular "console" way, you can use the "-nw" switch for "no window", such as: <code>emacs -nw assign01.cpp</code> .</li>
            <li>Because the physical lab systems have changed, if you have previously connected to one of the systems in the 201-210 range, your computer will have remembered its fingerprint in it's known hosts list. Because the fingerprint has now changed, you will get a security warning, and will not be able to connect to it. This can be resolved by removing that line from your known hosts file or by picking a different IP address to which you have not previously connected.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For information about how to configure your system for OpenGL and the graphics projects that we will work on later in the semester, see the page <a href="./165-opengl.html" target="_BLANK">Preparing for Graphics Projects</a>. But, note that you do not need to go through these steps until directed to, about half way through the semester.</p>
