        <h1>CS 165 TA Responsibilities</h1>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>Teaching Assistants (TAs) in CS 165 are very important to the success of the course, and it's ability to serve the number of students in each section.</p>

        <p>The main purpose of the TA is to help provide feedback to the students on their weekly assignments. The TA facilitates providing more detailed and timely feedback than the instructor could on their own, and allows the instructor to spend more time in mentoring and course discussions.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>

        <p>This document outlines the desired role and communication pattern of the TA and the instructor. In the end, the goal of the TA is to assist the instructor in grading as he/she sees fit. So if the instructor wishes, they can alter the way that the grading and communication takes place, but they should make sure to clearly communicate their expectations to the TA.

        <p>The TA should reach out to the instructor no later than Wednesday of the first week of class to make an introduction. At this point, the TA and the instructor should arrange a conference call to get to know one another better and to discuss expectations.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Rhythm</h2>

        <p>This class is organized at the weekly level, with the students submitting assignments every Monday night. The TA and instructor should arrange a consistent time to meet each week, soon after the Monday deadline. (For example, they may arrange to have a short video call every Tuesday at 4:30pm.)</p>

        <p>The TA should prepare for this meeting by becoming familiar with the weekly assignment. The instructor prepares for the meeting by collecting all the assignment submissions and emailing them to the TA.</p>

        <p>Then, in the meeting, the instructor and TA discuss the assignment, its expected functionality, and the most important design and coding principles that the assignment emphasizes. Then, the TA and instructor assess a few assignments together. They discuss comments and feedback that should be given for these assignments, as well as appropriate scoring.</p>

        <p>They decide together on a reasonable deadline to have the assignments finished, then, on their own time, the TA proceeds to grade the remainder of the assignments and emails the instructor when they are finished.</p>

        <h2>Feedback in I-Learn</h2>
        <p>Even though the students submit their assignments via the department Linux servers, the scores and feedback are reported back to them via the I-Learn gradebook.</p>

        <p>While the TA will provide an initial assessment of each submission, the instructor should go over these comments and scores to add any additional clarification they see fit. Then the instructor returns the score and the feedback to the student.</p>

        <p>In I-Learn, this draft/publishing process is best handled as folllows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The TA finds the assignment in I-Learn, and selects "Grade all".</p></li>
            <li><p>From this page, the TA clicks the feedback icon for the student they are currently assessing. This brings up a Feedback page with two boxes, "Feedback" and "Private Comments".</p></li>
            <li><p>The TA puts all of their feedback in the Private Comments box. Typically, they indicate the score at the top of the feedback, then listing comments below that.</p></li>
            <li><p>The TA saves this private feedback and moves on to the next student. This makes the feedback available to the instructor, but does not make it visible to the student.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the TA has finished grading all of the assignments, they should email the instructor.</p></li>
            <li><p>The instructor then selects grade all for the assignment in I-Learn.</p></li>
            <li><p>They click the feedback icon for each submission, copy and paste the feedback to the actual "Feedback" box, and clarify any comments that should be made.</p></li>
            <li><p>The instructor saves the Feedback and types the overall score into the Grade box on the main grade page. This makes the feedback and grade available to the student.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Feedback Timeliness</h2>
        <p>It is critical that feedback is provided to the students as quickly as possible. At a minimum, each assignment should be returned to the student within a week so they can apply that feedback to their next submission. In order for both the TA and the instructor to accomplish their tasks in that time frame, establishing a consistent weekly pattern is critical.</p>

        <h2>Addressing Performance Issues</h2>
        <p>If the TA will not be able to perform their tasks in a timely manner due to exceptional circumstances, they should communicate with the instructor as soon as possible, so other arrangements can be made for that week. If consistent problems arise, the instructor should first discuss it with the TA and communicate clear expectations. Then, if necessary, the instructor can refer the issue to the online hiring department. Together, they decide on the appropriate next steps and if necessary, the online hiring department follows through with any HR actions that must be taken.</p>
