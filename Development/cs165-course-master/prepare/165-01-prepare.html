        <h1>01 Prepare : Reading</h1>


        <p>Please read the following sections from your textbook:

            <ul>
                <li>Read over Unit 0 - "Review". (You may skip the sections on files and pointers, as we will review them next week.)</li>
                <li>In addition, from Unit 1, read the portion of Chapter 1.5 "Function: Advanced Topics", on Overloading and Default Parameters. You will read the remainder of this chapter in future weeks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Please note that we will NOT use the assignments and projects in the textbook. Many of them may look similar, but you should refer to I-Learn for the correct assignment specifications.</p>
