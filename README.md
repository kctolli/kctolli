As a Software Developer at Younique Products, I focus on Finance and Compliance Web and Data Systems. I have gained experience with JavaScript (Node JS, React JS, JQuery, Vanilla), Data Management Systems (Dynamodb, SQL, R, Excel, Mongodb), Docker, Git, NPM, AWS, PHP, among others.

I received my Bachelorâ€™s (BS) from BYU-Idaho in Software Engineering with minors in Computer Engineering and Data Science. While at BYU-Idaho, I earned Tau Beta Pi and Magna Cum Laude Honors. During my time in college, I learned a variety of topics in the Computer Science space, including Statistics, Calculus, Algorithms, Databases, Machine Learning, Embedded and Digital Systems.

When I'm not working, you'll find me expanding my horizons. I enjoy learning new technologies and sharing what I learn with others. I have a passion for solving problems and using technology to benefit life. I also like swimming, adventuring, spending time with family and creating new things.
