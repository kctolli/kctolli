# Kyle Tolliver

As a Software Developer at Younique Products, I focus on Finance and Compliance Web and Data Systems. I have gained experience with JavaScript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS), PHP, Database Management Systems (SQL, NoSQL), Docker, Git, AWS, and other useful tools. I was also able to collaborate with architects to build the most effective and efficient Restful APIs, while still maintaining a high level of quality and security.

I received my Bachelor's (BS) from BYU-Idaho in Software Engineering with minors in Computer Engineering and Data Science. While at BYU-Idaho, I earned Tau Beta Pi and Magna Cum Laude Honors. During my time in college, my course work included Statistics, Calculus, Databases, Machine Learning, Embedded and Digital Systems.

When I'm not working, I enjoy learning new technologies and sharing what I learn with others. I recently learned BunJS and NextJS. I am also involved in multiple technology communities, including Utah JS, Utah Stack JS and Utah Flutter. I have a passion for solving problems and using technology to benefit humanity. I have a variety of hobbies and interests including swimming, spending time with family and friends, painting, and maui thai.
