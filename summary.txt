As a Software Developer at Younique Products, I focus on Web Development and Data Systems. I have gained experience with JavaScript (Node JS, Express JS, JQuery, Vanilla), Data Systems (Dynamodb-AWS, MySQL, Oracle, R, Excel), Docker, NPM, among others. I received my Bachelor’s (BS) from BYU-Idaho in Software Engineering with minors in Computer Engineering and Data Science. I love to learn new things and solve problems.
