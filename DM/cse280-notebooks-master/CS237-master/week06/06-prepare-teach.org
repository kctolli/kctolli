  Many of you already know how to stop emacs from asking you every time you go
  to evaluate a code block, 

  /Evaluate this emacs-lisp code block on your system? (y or n)/

  If you don\rsquo{}t already know, read on. First, ponder: Why this prompt? Evaluating
  numbers or simple numeric expressions is a pretty benign activity, but that\rsquo{}s
  not true of evaluating some lisp code, which potentially can do bad things.
  Hence the safeguard confirmation prompt. But that gets tedious after a while.
  You can disable this prompt by setting a special controlling flag variable to
  nil. Specifically:

  SPC SPC customize-variable

  Then at the prompt type \ldquo{}org-confirm-babel-evaluate\rdquo (without the quotes), and
  hit Enter to bring up the Customization buffer.

  TAB (10 times) to the button labeled /Toggle/, and click on it or hit Enter to
  press it. The state message will change to say:

  STATE: EDITED, shown value does not take effect until you set or save it.

  Shift-TAB (3 times) back to the /Apply and Save/ button and hit Enter again. 
  That changes the state message to:

  STATE: Saved and set.

  Dismiss the Customization buffer by typing q.

  The *Prepare* activity was an exercise in /decision-making/, a task all of us
  must perform many times, every day of our lives. What if we could offload that
  burden?

  Read [[https://firstthreeodds.org/17657741833134731255/total-noise.html][these thoughts]] by David Foster Wallace, discuss, and respond with your
  best thinking. For full credit you must record your thoughts in an MI-free
  paragraph, below.

#+begin_paragraph
I found it interesting how David Wallace compared fiction to an absence of
noise, whereas nonfiction was defined as total noise. I found the last paragraph
especially interesting. It reads: "many of [the virtues of good writing] have to
do with the ways in which the pieces handle and respond to the tsunami of
available fact, context, and perspective that constitutes Total Noise. [Those
that are most valuable] serve as models and guides for how large of complex sets
of facts can be sifted, culled, and arranged in meaningful ways â€” ways that
yield and illuminate truth instead of just adding more noise to the overall
roar." We should strive to find efficient and meaningful ways to solve problems,
in order to yield more relevant information and insight.
