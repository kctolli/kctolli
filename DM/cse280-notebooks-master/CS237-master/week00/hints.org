  A Hint about Hints:

  With your cursor on a :HINT: line, pressing TAB will toggle the open/close
  state of these \ldquo{}drawers\rdquo, as org-mode refers to them.

  They are all closed when you first open this file. Open them only after you
  take the opportunity to see how far you can get without them.

  Also, at the top of this file note the \ldquo{}not\rdquo in the first #+OPTIONS: header.
  This controls the invisibility of the HINT drawers when exporting this org
  file to html, which you can do by the following key sequence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  , e e h o
#+END_EXAMPLE

:HINT:
  - Hint :: Do not be picky about the wording \ldquo{}There is no right answer\rdquo, which
            could be interpreted as \ldquo{}There is no answer that you could give that
            would be right.\rdquo That would be a misinterpretation.

:HINT:
  - Hint :: A \ldquo{}word\rdquo with no vowels is a clear winner of the smallest contest --
            a VCR can\rsquo{}t be less than zero. So don\rsquo{}t count VCRs equal to zero.
            That way, tying for first place at 1/3 would be \lsquo{}What\rsquo, \lsquo{}word\rsquo and
            \lsquo{}smallest\rsquo.
  - Also :: Count /y/ as a vowel, even when it is the first letter of a word.
:END:

:HINT:
  - Hint :: Another name for this problem is the /Limiting Radius/ problem, and
            a /trigonometric approach/ to it is suggested by this image:

  - DOK
:HINT:
  - Hint :: In case it wasn\rsquo{}t clear, you are being asked to form the product of
            3 numbers. And to do that over and over again, as many times as it
            takes.
  - Hint :: Try dividing all the products by 6.
  - Time Hint :: There is another connection to be made, but to pursue this
                 quest is potentially time-consuming.
:END:

  - CJF
:HINT:
  - Hint :: Split the 6-digit number into two 3-digit numbers, and think of the
            word CLOCK (what CLAHCK really should be) as a sequence of 5 letters:
: 654 321
:
: C L O C K
