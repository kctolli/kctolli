        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>Your assignment for this week will be to build an express app that handles two routes.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Use GET to display a page with inputs for a user to input a book and summary</p></li>
            <li><p>Using a form and POST submit the inputs to a display page that looks nice and shows the title and summary 
                back to the user (use template engines for this (Use EJS, because this is what we are going to 
                continue to use for the rest of the semester)</p></li>
            <li><p>While not required, a way to go above and beyond to reach full credit would be to save multiple
                user entries. This would entail using a JSON file <b>or</b> a local variable containing book titles and summaries.</p></li>
            <li><p>Please review rubric below to see how you'll be graded and to ensure you've completed each aspect of this assignment.</p></li>
            <li><p>Push code to Heroku</p></li>
            <div class="tips">
                <p>Getting Heroku set up with a project can be difficult at first. If you are having issues, these videos may help.</p>
