        <h1>Syllabus</h1>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>This course builds upon Web Engineering I allowing students to create more advanced web applications and services. The emphasis of this course will be on server-side technologies and n-tier applications using NoSQL database technology. Client side technologies will be enhanced and combined with server-side technologies to create rich web applications. At the end of this semester successful students will be able to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Know how to learn</p></li>
            <li><p>Possess well-developed problem-solving skills</p></li>
            <li><p>Articulate and follow effective design principles, patterns, and practices to create maintainable web services</p></li>
            <li><p>Independently learn, evaluate, and apply new technologies</p></li>
            <li><p>Work collaboratively with a development team</p></li>
            <li><p>Be excited about possibilities of web development</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
        <p>Prepare: You will be reading reference and tutorial websites.</p>
        <p>Teach One Another: You will be participating in team activities, posting helpful links, and working on team projects.</p>
        <p>Ponder and Prove: You will be doing weekly programming assignments (both individual and team-based).</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

            <li><p>WDD230 - Web Frontend Development I</p></li>
            <li><p>CS165 - Object-Oriented Software Development OR CS213 - Web Engineering I</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Course Communication</h2>
        <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>We will use Teams as the communication tool in this class.  Announcements and class information will be communicated here. It is your responsibility to stay up to date with this. Please install it on your computer and mobile device.</p></li>
            <li><p>WE WILL NOT communicate via I-Learn or email, we will only use Teams.</p></li>
            <li><p>Download Teams here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Join Teams with the link provided by your instructor</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Course Materials Needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Textbook: Academind Course ($12) - Create account with byui email. You will receive a link from your instructor, please do not share it with anyone.</p></li>
            <li><p>Web hosting at Heroku. Free for basic usage.</p></li>
            <li><p>Github account</p></li>
            <li><p>VS Code (or another text editor of your choice)</p></li>
            <li><p>NodeJS installed on computer</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Course Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Team Activity Instructions</h3>
        <p>Each week, there will be a team activity designed to help reinforce the concept that will be covered that week, and give students an opportunity to teach one another, and to be prepared for the weekly assignment. These activities are to be completed in teams, and are designed to be completed in 60-90 minutes. Each activity is designed to be a straightforward application of the concepts of the week to help prepare students for the weekly assignment, which will require significantly more application, adaptation, and problem solving skills.</p>
        <h3>Assignments</h3>
        <p>Each week you will have a personal assignment due at 11:59pm on Saturday. These assignments are similar to your team activities each week as far as the content is concerned, but is meant to expand and prove your knowledge.</p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>Your projects throughout the semester will either be individual or with a team, according to your instructor's discretion. Regardless, you will have two large projects to complete this semester. One will be alongside the Academind course, and the other will be for the second half of the semester to apply what you have learned. This second project will account for the majority of your grade in the course.</p>
        <h2>Course Expectations and Policies</h2>
        <h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
        <p>In short: No late work is accepted. </p>
        <p>Assignments are graded promptly after their due dates with feedback to help with future assignments. Videos with solutions are also posted shortly after their due dates in order to help you study and move forward. Because of this, and the other reasons listed above, late work will not be accepted. </p>
        <p>Canvas is configured to deduct 20% per day starting with one minute after the deadline until it is graded.  Anyone who has not submitted the assignment by the time they have all been graded will receive a zero. Once an assignment has been graded, reviews and grade alterations will not be made on additional submissions.  </p>
        <p>Your ability to plan ahead, and be responsible for your work and the associated deadlines will be vital in your success in furthering both your education and career. </p>
        <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
        <p>Grades for most assignments (unless otherwise noted) are assigned in broad terms according to the following scale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>50% - Some attempt was made</p></li>
            <li><p>70% - Developing, but significantly deficient</p></li>
            <li><p>85% - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate</p></li>
            <li><p>93% - Meets Requirements</p></li>
            <li><p>100% - Shows Creativity, and a desire to excel above and beyond</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This course will use the following standard BYU-Idaho grading scale:</p>

        <h3>Changes to Schedule and Assignments</h3>
        <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes by your instructor.</p>
        <h3>Plagiarism Policy</h3>
        <p>Just like a writing class, software programming classes must have policies to prevent plagiarism.</p>
        <p>Your code must be created by you.  If you use any code from online or from another person (i.e. team member, previous student, roommate, relative, tutor), you must provide credit in the comments of your code.  The comments must include the name of the person or the website URL.  You may not get full points if you use too much work from others.  Using code from others without giving proper credit is an honor code violation resulting in both a grade of 0 and a report to the honor office.  When in doubt, provide credit in your code.</p>
        <p>The only exception to this rule is any code or assistance you receive from your teacher or an official class TA.  If you get help from the Tutoring Center or from the Computer Science Help Center, you must provide credit in your code.</p>
        <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.</p>
        <p>Please reference the University Academic Honesty policy here: <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty" target="_blank">http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty</a> </p>
        <h3>Extenuating Circumstances</h3>
        <p>An “Extenuating Circumstance” is defined as one involving either a family or medical emergency. If an “Extenuating Circumstance” prevents you from meeting any expectation or deadline, please try to communicate with me before the expectation or deadline is missed.</p>
        <h3>Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>
        <p>BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Prohibited sex discrimination includes incidents of sexual harassment (including sexual violence), dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking (collectively “sexual misconduct”).</p>
        <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. University policy requires that I report all incidents of sexual misconduct that come to my attention. If you encounter sexual misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@byui.edu or 208-496-9200. Additional information about sexual misconduct and available resources can be found at <a href="www.byui.edu/titleix" target="_blank">www.byui.edu/titleix</a>.</p>
