        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>After completing the assigned reading for the week and your team activity, you are prepared to complete your personal assignment. Your assignment will be done in the repo you downloaded as part of your team activity and will consist of creating a form, sending data to the server, then displaying that data in a different part of your webpage. This will help you learn how to work with git, data, pages, and client-server communication.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Your first assignment will be to create a server that handles at least two different endpoints.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Create <code>prove01.js</code> (name is up to you) file in the routes folder. (Folder already exists from download in team activity)    </p></li>
            <li><p>Create a route to your <code>prove01.js</code> file in your index.js file         </p></li>
            <li><p>In your views folder create a two <code>.ejs</code> files (Or pug/handlebars if you chose to use either of those)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>One view with a simple form with two inputs</p></li>
                    <li><p>Another view to display the input back to the user</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Parse the users input on the server and send the input to second view    </p></li>
            <li><p>Be sure to use nodemon                                               </p></li>
            <li><p>Push your code up to Github. </p></li>
